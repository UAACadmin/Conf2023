		    		<p>In Banff in 1991, artist Rebecca Belmore performed the first of many iterations of her sculptural performance, <i>Ayum-ee-aawach Oomama-mowan: Speaking to Their Mother</i>, in which she invited Indigenous peers and community members to speak directly to the land through a giant megaphone, in response to the colonial violence perpetuated by the recent Kahnesat&agrave;:ke resistance. With Belmore&rsquo;s work as the starting point, this session traces the impact of ephemeral forms of artmaking in public spaces. How have artists used voice, movement and temporary intervention outside of gallery walls? How can ephemeral practices support new connections and narratives without leaving permanent marks on the land? What factors have contributed to the resonance and longevity of temporary projects like Belmore&rsquo;s, decades later? With perspectives from artists, curators, scholars and activists, this session seeks to build new vocabularies for art in public space in Canada, with an emphasis on impermanence as a strategy and methodology. Together the panellists present deep dives into individual practices, sites and experiences, and reflect on a range of topics from action, power and presence in public spaces, to manifestations of care and joy.</p>

    				<p>I will outline how in my work I have used ephemerality, performance and deliberately temporary interventions in public space as strategies to create a sense of urgency and a need to reckon with situations in the present. These tactics attempt to enact a &ldquo;call to attention&rdquo; to immediate conditions in the changing world around us, and hope to suggest the potential of acting in the moment. I will discuss performance-based works such as <i>Erratic</i>, <i>HIGH NOON</i>, and <i>League</i>; clearly ephemeral works such as <i>Homemaking</i>; and time- and process-based works such as <i>Fallow</i> and <i>Knitwork</i>. I will also discuss how I have attempted to maintain the values of malleability, uncertainty and play when operating in the realm of public art.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Evie Ruddy</strong><span class="school">, Carleton University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>In March 2023, in the city colonially known as Regina, a friend and I went undercover to anonymously project trans-positive text onto the highest part of a building in which anti-trans activist Jordan Peterson spoke to a sold-out auditorium. The messages &ndash; trans people are beautiful, trans women are women, all pronouns are valid, and trans joy forever &ndash; cycled at 10-second intervals and marked the building for a total of six minutes. Despite this site-based intervention being fleeting, the projected messages were visually documented and widely circulated on social media platforms, generating joy and care for a trans community under attack and filled with despair.</p> 
					<p>Although our initial impulse was to project punchy messages that responded directly to anti-trans rhetoric, when my friend and I &ndash; both transmasc &ndash; met to test the projections, we found ourselves joyfully conversing about our shared experiences with testosterone and shifted toward a strategy of care. In this paper, I draw on Hil Malatino&rsquo;s <i>Trans Care</i> (2020) and Sara Ahmed&rsquo;s theories of queer phenomenology (2006) and affect (2014) to discuss how this strategy transformed the discourse around this event from one of hate to trans joy. How did this ephemeral intervention enact a politics of care for trans people? What is the significance of creating t4t messaging as opposed to speaking back to the oppressor? What possibilities does the digital appropriation of public space, as opposed to conventional forms of protest, offer trans communities under attack?</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Shalon T. Webber-Heffernan</strong><span class="school">, York University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p><i>How does land hold memory; how does it perform? If the space is an archive, how do we become attuned to it? How might we connect with the resonant environment and all that inhabits it?</i></p>
					<p>This presentation puts two participatory artworks/temporary monuments that intercepted the US/Mexico border into dialogue: Cannupa Hanska Luger&rsquo;s <i>Something to Hold Onto</i> (2020) and Postcommodity&rsquo;s <i>Repellent Fence</i> (2015). Both projects consider ancestral migratory routes and the lands of Indigenous peoples affected by imposed borders, acknowledging complex remembering across time. I argue that the aesthetic strategies employed by these artists call for ways of attuning that tend not only physical space, but spatial and temporal dimensions that encompass other realms, as well&mdash;such as the subconscious dream world, deep time, or aspects of ceremonial life.</p>
					<p>Considering also how these projects include the participation of community members, and government stakeholders, across diversity and interests, in generative conversations&mdash;I think of these projects as a means of broadcasting the complexity of movement (peoples, cultures, ideologies and capital) of the U.S./M&eacute;xico trans border systems and knowledges. These ephemeral monuments temporarily resisted the systematic forgetting of colonial and imperial histories&mdash;and complicated geopolitical discourses beyond the logics of divisive us-and-them politics. In both instances the land became a mediator and a means for re-building public memory and recovering knowledge in a trans-border context. This presentation is influenced by my broader research which contemplates aesthetic strategies encouraging attunement to spatial and temporal dimensions of site and environment. I consider nonappearance itself as an agentic actor and reflecting on the power and meaning  of that which is unseen, reverberating with the longer, deeper stories held within this land, calling out for attunement.</p>

		    		<h3><i>Multidirectional Carework: Imprinting Diasporic Imaginaries in Public Space</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Laurel V. McLaughlin</strong><span class="school">, Bryn Mawr College</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>In <i>Monumental Cares: Sites of History and Contemporary Art</i> (2023) art historian Mechtild Widrich argues for a multidirectional theory of site, in which artists, publics, and artworks actively engage in public carework. This dynamic carework&mdash;of movement&mdash;undermines the staid and permanent assumed character of a public work, as it is administered across, through, and into site with publics. In this paper, I trace the multidirectional carework of practitioners Emilio Rojas, Azza El Siddique, and Dawit L. Petros in mark-making gestures of smearing, dripping, and staining that imprint themselves within communities. In the 25-hour performance <i>The Grass is Always Greener and/or Twice Stolen Land</i>, 2014, Rojas smears a patch of grass 7 km from UBC to the Musqueam Reserve; in the site-specific installation 2021, <i>Fade Into the Sun</i>, el Siddique drips Sudanese bakhoor into the air through an irrigation system inside the architectural scaffolding of a Nubian burial chamber; and in <i>Inscribed Surfaces: On Transient Histories</i>, 2022, Petros forges diasporic community through henna staining of modernist utopic building plans. Whether by dirt, incense, or henna, these ephemeral gestures interact multidirectionally with public architectures&mdash;the University campus/stolen land, the public museum/the heritage burial chamber, a storefront/colonial structures&mdash;diasporic imaginaries of Mexico, Sudan, and Eritrea, respectively, infiltrating Canadian settler logics. Together the works in these case studies create a lexicon of ephemeral imprinting upon land and in/on bodies that unveils the inextricable incorporation of the two and the dynamic care required to sustain imaginaries.</p>
