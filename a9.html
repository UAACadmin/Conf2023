How might we explore the places, times, and approaches where Blackness speaks from, speaks to, and speaks back in ways that creates or acts as a &ldquo;homeplace&rdquo; (hooks, 1990) for Black scholarship and artist scholars? Submissions that explore Black epistemologies and ontologies by utilizing written, sonic, visual, embodied, and integrative art practices are welcome.</p>

Her research focus is ethics of care, Black feminist thought, and Indigenous African thought and their application to re-designing systems of education. She is an artist, writer, and researcher. Her (research) creation attends to a process that is guided by trans-temporal collaborators who challenge ideas around the relationship to art and productivity, labour, and authorship. Myrtle was awarded a Canada Graduate Scholarship grant and is a nominated Vanier Scholar. Her latest exhibit, <i>The Body Speaks</i>, a Canada Council of the Arts funded project, is an integrative storytelling event that revives Afro-Caribbean storytelling through visual arts and performances. Through her community work she has conducted civil engagement arts-based research projects that focus on new world creation.</p>

    				<p>I propose to conduct a performance of my solo exhibition, <a href="https://aspacegallery.org/program/they-say-we-cant-breathe-underwater/" target="_blank"><i>They Say We Can&rsquo;t Breathe Underwater</i></a> (A Space Gallery, 2022). I plan to take viewers on a tour under the waters in the Black Atlantic where we follow the Orisha deity Yemaya and navigate the history of the slave trade and the middle passage as we descend to the ocean floor. She acts as a guide taking us to depths where we encounter epistemologies of Black care and where we are reminded we can learn to breathe in unbreathable circumstances and can find and recover healing practices for ourselves and others in the Black community facing anti-Black racism. This is a meditative journey taking viewers down to the ocean floor and back up again to find the crossroads of Carnival, to encounter joy in movement and breath. During the tour the viewers become travellers who are encouraged to flow with and be open to the healing gifts of Yemaya and our Black ancestors. This exhibit was designed to promote practices of collective care for Black communities struggling to navigate anti Black racism and other forms of oppression. In my artwork the Black Atlantic becomes a Black geography, a tidal map to reclaim our practices of care and work towards abolition and re-worlding.</p>

    				<p>A burgeoning body of literature explores the experiences of Black mother scholars. Such works underscore our use of artistic inquiry processes to assert ourselves as knowledge producers within university settings. Scant Canadian literature explores the ways that we, Black mother scholars, use the art of storytelling to prioritize knowledge production and dissemination within public spaces. In fact, Canadian literature on Black mother scholars continues to overlook our rich legacy of using stories to ask, answer, and share epistemological and ontological questions in our own voices (Onuora, 2012, 2015). In fact, we enjoy a rich research tradition grounded in the art of storytelling. We share our ideas through writing, dancing, drawing, spittin&rsquo; rhymes, and other expressions of storytelling (Love, 2019). Indeed, the academy has long shunned the artistic ways we leverage our storied lives to engage our children, families, and communities in research (Toliver, 2021).</p> 
					<p>My talk explores how Black mothers use the art of storytelling to challenge governing notions of academic scholarship. Centring my work with a group of Black immigrant women who are adult literacy learners, I showcase my use of visual and oral storytelling to reimagine knowledge dissemination processes as homeplace for Black mothers. I draw on Black feminist notions of homeplace, Black motherwork theory, and Endarkened storywork to discuss the ways I continue the legacy of Black mothers as public storytellers serving our communities. I close my talk by offering researchers a series of reflection questions to facilitate the reimagining of knowledge dissemination as homeplace for Black mothers.</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>As Sylvia Wynter outlines, the assignment of the Black body to the bottommost positioning of the human hierarchy was the rationalization for the ensuing subjugation and classification of Black people as non/human. This positioning, serving an imperialist, white supremacist and capitalist agenda, set the pre-individual conditions of chattel slavery, Jim Crow, the eradication of generational wealth and the ever-present reality of police brutality for the African diaspora. While the thread running through the lives of Black people became that of mourning, there was resistance. As Moten and Fanon suggest, a separation exists between Blackness and those defined as Black. For Moten, Blackness predates the Black individual, and it is prior to ontology. While for Fanon, the Black individual is defined in relation to whiteness, an exclusionary space relegating the Black individual to nothingness. As such, it can be argued that Blackness occupies that indefinable and affectual space which Gregg and Seigworth characterize as &quot;in-betweenness,&quot; an embodied intensity of &quot;human, non-human, part-body, part otherwise.&quot; For those categorized as Black and assumed to carry Blackness as their defining characteristic, their ensuing transduction, in the Wake of ongoing systemic violence, birthed a new collective being/ness. The enduring shimmer of Blackness carried collectively is the affectual resonance that circulates and sticks to bodies and worlds. And though this collective presence of no/thingness often &quot;barely registers,&quot; their shimmering residue traces their immersion, rhythms and refusals as they consistently emerge and erupt into new becomings. Therefore Blackness, the affect of the Black collective, transcends the impulsiveness of Deluezian movement toward an opaque neutrality. An enduring state of movement's refusal, wherein the collective neither act nor are motivated by it.</p>
