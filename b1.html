		    		<p>This session will investigate the relationship between photography and activism, considering the camera&rsquo;s role in both recording and facilitating resistance movements. Photography and activism have been linked since, at least, the emergence of photojournalism, with media representation of direct action, demonstrations and confrontations between protestors and authorities contributing to public perception of activist causes and responses. In recent years, the camera has become even  more embedded in social justice movements with the capacity to record moving from the  professional to the participant and footage instantaneously uploaded. Activists have long recognized  the power of photography, redeploying graphic imagery to expose atrocity and/or harnessing the camera to document or counter oppressive representation. This session includes papers that consider photography&rsquo;s employment as both an activist tool and a means of recording or facilitating resistance.</p>

    				<p>In August 1971 and 1972 the university student Matsumoto Michiko attended training camps for the <i>&#363;man ribu</i> (Women&rsquo;s Liberation) movement in Japan in Nagano and Hokkaido where she documented the participants as they were deep in discussion over changes they wanted to see in Japanese society. Her photographs envision the energy, as the women, in Setsu Shigematsu&rsquo;s telling &ldquo;imagined liberation as the struggle against and beyond the binary confines of competing empires of capitalism and communism and conceived of itself as part of the ongoing multitude of liberation struggles organizing across the globe&rdquo; (<i>Scream from the Shadows: The Women&rsquo;s Liberation Movement in Japan</i> (Minneapolis and London: University of Minnesota Press, 2012)). In this talk I analyze the relationships of power that constructed notions of who should have the right to photograph the women&rsquo;s liberation movement and debates around how it should be photographed. Focusing on Japan in the 1960s and 1970s, I explore how the Women&rsquo;s Liberation movement and photographic theory intersected and influenced each other, and how each grew from a shared political investment with the politics of representation. Addressing the photographic representations of the Women&rsquo;s Liberation movement in Japan also provides the opportunity to expand our understandings the collective movements to visualize photographs of protest movements in the Global 1960s. In the Japanese case, how did photographs of protest taken by women photographers or depicting women protesting contribute to the boader visual culture of and social formations around the protest photograph?</p>

		    		<h3><i>The Goose Village</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Marisa Portolese</strong><span class="school">, Concordia University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>Goose Village is a multi-disciplinary body of work about a six-street borough once located in Pointe St-Charles, Montreal, bulldozed in 1964 in anticipation of Expo 67. The administration of Mayor Jean Drapeau demolished the entire neighbourhood to make way for the short-lived venue of the Autostade sports arena, eradicating 350 buildings and evicting 1500 people from their homes. Adding insult to injury, the arena faced its' demise less than a decade later and was dismantled in 1976. As a result, Goose Village became a parking lot and disappeared from Montreal maps, obliterating certain ethnic groups from this undervalued site's cultural and social fabric.</p>
					<p>Through still and moving images, installation, sound, writing and web/graphic design encompassing a myriad of genres such as memory mapping, oral history, portraiture, storytelling, the urban landscape, and a forensic gaze into historical institutional archives and private family albums, I explore the history of this once thriving neighbourhood. Goose Village is not only motivated by the social underpinnings of my art practice but intrinsic to my roots in the city and my identity as a second- generation Canadian. I am inexorably linked to this ostensibly tight-knit community because of my immigrant and familial heritage, as it is where the paternal side of my family settled when they emigrated from Calabria, Italy.</p>
					<p>Goose Village signals how poor urban planning decisions negatively affect and displace working-class communities. The purpose is to highlight the destructive consequences of hallmark events and to commemorate the villagers' memories through an autobiographical and empathetic lens.</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>In the center of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, about an hour outside of the capital city of Belo Horizonte, is the Instituto Inhotim, a veritable fantasyland of contemporary art set across almost 2000 acres. The museum lies within the municipality of Brumadinho, a small town best known for the catastrophic damage it suffered after a nearby tailings dam collapsed in 2019, killing 270 people. The development and art production of the region are inherently intertwined with mining: the state  name means &ldquo;general mines,&rdquo; the earliest settlements were mining towns, and Inhotim itself was initially financed by Brazilian mining magnate Bernardo Paz. While mining has financed significant artistic production&mdash;from Baroque churches to Inhotim&rsquo;s architectural pavilions&mdash;it has also wrought destruction on the indigenous peoples and landscape. Photographer Ju&#769;lia Pont&eacute;s elaborates the impacts of the region&rsquo;s historical and contemporary mining infrastructure in her still imagery and film works, which dovetail with her personal activism. Her series <i>Minas Gerais: Our Land, My Landscape</i> explores the haunting artificiality&mdash;and sometimes the seductive beauty of natural landscapes altered by mining. The images have been employed by both museums and media outlets to illustrate the &ldquo;slow violence&rdquo; of mineral extraction in  Brazil. Utilizing her background in law and economics, Pont&eacute;s has recently documented the effects of elevated environmental toxicity on local populations, highlighting the ways that traditional histories of the region have elided mining&rsquo;s traumatic impacts.</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>Activist artworks are mostly created in a context that affords the artist physical and/or temporal distance from the event or demonstration, while in most circumstances the photographer&rsquo;s work requires actual physical presence. An increasing global context over the past half-century means that graphic imagery associated with activism are pictures drawn mostly from international  events&#8213;demonstrations for civil rights and against the Vietnam War are well-known examples. But what about photography&rsquo;s application as an activist tool and/or means of recording resistance by artists and photographers in Canada? For example, Suzy Lake&rsquo;s photographic tryptic <i>Cautioned Homes and Gardens: Barb and Janie</i> (1991), was part of the artists&rsquo; social activism to denounce the Ontario government&rsquo;s intrusion on First Nations land. Since the 1970s Lake had become &ldquo;more invested in the local struggles that surrounded her and their links to global liberation movements.&rdquo; (Silver, 2021). In 1988, performance artist Daniel Guimond, presented <i>The Prick</i>, a performance work with a multitude of shocking drug addiction photos projected with slides at Western Front,  Vancouver. Clara Gutsche and David Miller took photographs during the early 1970s to denounce the gentrification of the Milton Park neighbourhood motivated by their &lsquo;belief that collective effort could create a better society.&rdquo; (Gutsche, 2021) My paper will consider select Canadian camera-based artworks and social documentary photographs to examine the changing use of photography as a tool for creating and/or recording activism and resistance since the 1960, a period when art meant to induce emotions had, for many, reached its end.</p>

		    		<h3><i>Radical Contemporary Visual Culture: Black Activist Public Art in N’Swakamok</i></h3>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>In 2020, amidst the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, an unprecedented emergence of Black activist public art appeared in N&rsquo;Swakamok, later colonized as Sudbury, Ontario. Through the analysis of three case studies; initiatives facilitated by BLM Sudbury (Fig. 1), collective and individual works by SOLARIS arts collective, and a series of independent initiatives, this research utilizes an autoethnographic approach to contemplate the ways in which Black activist public art permeates beyond urban centres and develops within rural white dominant communities. Utilizing an intersectional and accessible framework, this work demonstrates the  importance of these Black activist public art initiatives and how they shape the larger Canadian art  historical narrative.</p>
					<p>The largest city in Northern Ontario, N&rsquo;Swakamok (Sudbury, Ontario) has a population of 166,004, of which Black people make up less than 1%. Despite Black people representing such a small portion of the area&rsquo;s demographics, within a contemporary context, they have produced impressive feats of activist art interventions that have meaningfully altered public perception and created networks for advocacy surrounding anti-Black racism, white supremacy, and intersectional awareness of marginalized individuals. In presenting a historical context for the emergence of said work, this proposal seeks to provide a framework for other rural communities across the lands of so-called Canada, while  centring the need for work of this calibre and the ongoing implications for justice, equity, decolonization,  diversity, and inclusivity (JEDDI) in N&rsquo;Swakamok.</p>
