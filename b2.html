		    		<p>Perhaps we can think of our time as characterized by precarity. From ecosystems to economic systems, everything that once appeared solid is now exposed as delicately balanced, on thin ice. Within this situation, we find our own individual lives overtaken, threatened by that which has come to define us&mdash;our labour. At one end of the spectrum is the precarity caused by the constant pressure to perform and at the other end is &ldquo;poorly paid, unprotected, insecure work.&rdquo; From Santiago Sierra&rsquo;s &ldquo;Twelve Workers Paid to Remain Inside Cardboard Boxes&rdquo; to Mika Rottenberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dough,&rdquo; artists have looked at different systems that exploit the labouring body, while others have emphasized the right to be unproductive. This session invites papers from researchers and artists who look at the issues related to labour and work, especially how precarity is created through movement (economic migration), work permits, productivity, exhaustion&mdash;of both human and natural resources.</p>

		    		<h3><i>Stitching Together an Empire: Inka Control of Women&rsquo;s Labor</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Katie Elizabeth Ligmond</strong><span class="school">, University of California, Santa Cruz</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>Textiles were the emblematic prestige item of the Inka empire, who sought to control the labor of their subjects above all else. The Inka spoke Quechua, as do some eight million people currently living in the Andes, and their word for beautiful is &ldquo;wairuru&rdquo; literally translating to &ldquo;well-made.&rdquo; The Inka held control over all wairuru textiles, which had their own name: cumbi. While male subjects of the Inka empire were expected to complete labor tribute, women faced their own kind of subjugation. All women were expected to weave for the Inka state, but the best were removed from their homes and cloistered in Inka centers. These &ldquo;chosen women&rdquo; were called aclla, and were simultaneously exalted as the most superior designers, but endured harsh conditions often being given as sacrifices or unwilling brides to Inka elites. Furthering their suffering, is the idea that pervades the Andes, that to produce a wairuru object is to deposit a bit of one&rsquo;s own being into that object. In fact, many scholars now call such creations &ldquo;subject-objects&rdquo; to denote the idea that these masterworks embody the personhood of their makers. The iconography of Inka textiles has been much discussed, but little has been said about the bodies of the women who made these textiles, and the bodies of the textiles themselves. In this paper I propose that we focus on the materiality of Inka textiles as pieces of women&rsquo;s own selves, thus, the Inka sought to control not just labor, but their citizens&rsquo; very souls.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Robin Alex McDonald</strong><span class="school">, MacEwan University</span></li>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>In 2015 CBC launched <i>Crash Gallery</i>, a reality TV show in which artists eagerly compete against one another. Each episode involves three artist-contestants tasked with creating art under challenging circumstances, including being submerged into basins of water, strapped to inversion tables and flipped upside down, and suspended from the ceiling. Compensation for the artist-contestants is &ldquo;TBD after casting&rdquo; (Casting Call for Artists, 2015) and they labour in front of a live audience-jury for a &ldquo;prize&rdquo;&mdash;either a wet painter&rsquo;s palette or a tiny trophy. While <i>Crash Gallery</i> has understandably been characterized as &ldquo;outlandish,&rdquo; &ldquo;slapstick&rdquo; (Morgan-Feir, 2018), and an &ldquo;absurd&rdquo; and &ldquo;bizarre&rdquo; &ldquo;caricature&rdquo; of art and artists (Balzer, Morgan-Feir and Prata, 2015), we argue that the series may present a closer approximation of artists&rsquo; labour conditions than such phrases suggest. In our paper, we propose an alternative reading of the series that understands <i>Crash Gallery</i> as a surprisingly revealing depiction of &ldquo;labor conditions normalized under neoliberalism&rdquo; (Couldry, 3). Specifically, the challenges involve artists competing under tight deadlines, for questionable pay and symbolic prizes, all-the-while romanticizing precarious and uncomfortable&mdash;even dangerous&mdash;forms of labour. Moreover, the series depicts artists as ideal neoliberal workers: passionate, flexible, efficient, entrepreneurial, inexpensive, impermanent, disposable, able-bodied, amenable to surveillance, willingly blurring the boundaries between work and leisure, and individually shouldering risk and responsibility. Reality TV has been characterized as &ldquo;the secret theater of neoliberalism&rdquo; (Couldry, 2008), while artists are increasing &ldquo;hailed as 'model entrepreneurs'&rdquo; and &ldquo;exemplars of the move away from stable notions of 'career' to more informal, insecure and discontinuous employment&rdquo; (Gill and Pratt, 2013, 26). Combining academic literature on neoliberalism, reality TV, and artistic labour with an original analysis of the series and paratexts about the show, we suggest that <i>Crash Gallery</i> presents a surprisingly relevant portrait of artists&rsquo; labour under neoliberalism.</p>

		    		<h3>Care-laboration: pleasure, care and healing through collaboration in the academy</i></h3>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>In 2017, we (Drs. Julia Chan and St&eacute;fy McKnight) created the research-creation performance duo Cam Hunters. This collaboration came from our mutual interest in surveillance studies, art, and performance, but more importantly our friendship. Cam Hunters has always interrogated spaces of care, especially when revealing and engaging with the ways that surveillance disproportionally affects marginalized, queer, 2SLGBTQIA+, racialized, and Indigenous folx across the world. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in our academic positions from precarity to permanent faculty members, we have adapted our collaborative methods to prioritize our self-care and ability to exist and work in careless spaces, like universities.</p> 
					<p>Cam Hunters has created a framework and methodology that prioritizes care and pleasure in our professional and personal lives, that seeks to disrupt normative timelines of productivity, deadlines, and labour expectations. We use the term &ldquo;care-laboration&rdquo; to highlight that even collaboration centres labor and work in the academy. We wish to contribute to this roundtable by sharing the ways that we have integrated care into our collaboration and positions in the academy, such as hosting care-centric meetings, creating codes of conduct that prioritize care, reflecting on our personal differences and experiences, having personal movie nights together, and disrupting timelines for completing projects. More importantly, Cam Hunters prioritizes our friendship and our mutual care for each other while we navigate the pressures of the academy, and creating pleasurable and healing work for us!</p>

		    		<h3>Obvious truths about working in the arts: How the labour of racialized cultural workers is consumed by the white-dominant sector</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Marsya Maharani &amp; Petrina Ng</strong><span class="school">, Gendai / York University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>Toxic and discriminatory labour practices continue to proliferate across our cultural institutions, despite a significant rise of newly reformed institutional mandates and public-facing exhibitions that purport commitments to decolonization, equity, solidarity, and care (Ware, 2020; McNamara, 2020; Black, 2020; etc). Further, the ways in which abuses of power manifest in the daily experiences of BIPOC arts workers are eerily similar from one organization to another. Based on dozens of informal interviews with racialized arts workers in entry-level or middle-management positions, our recent research charts the patterns of racism, toxic masculinity, and exploitation happening across Canada&rsquo;s art institutions (Gendai, 2023). We use gossip as a methodology, centering storytelling&rsquo;s capacity to &ldquo;map the contours of oppression&rdquo; (Garneau, 2019). With a focus on building trust within racialized and equity-seeking communities, we&rsquo;ve sought to understand the ways that the toxicity of our workplaces continue to silence, undermine, gaslight, exclude, and diminish us.</p>
    				<p>This paper grounds our gossip in scholarship on systemic racism in cultural institutions. Sara Ahmed&rsquo;s work on how the intricacies of power uphold the status quo is useful as a framework to better understand how white dominant culture continues to shape museums as workplaces. Citing case studies in Canada and the US, we demonstrate how the same patterns of institutional violence have repeated throughout history, interrupted by waves of racial reckoning (D&rsquo;Souza 2020; Fatona, 2011; Gagnon 2000, 2002; Golden, 2015; etc). We close by offering potential strategies on how to stop this cycle, citing the ways in which Gendai refuses to be &ldquo;professional,&rdquo; and consumed by white institutions.</p>
