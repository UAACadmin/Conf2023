		    		<p>This session seeks to explore the personal side of professional academic life over the past three years, under the weight of the latest global pandemic still impacting our work and ourselves constantly yet unevenly. So much of academic work is bound up in the pressure to participate in professional hustle culture, at all levels from graduate school to academic and alt-academic career paths. We often discount the personal toll that such consistent and often non-boundaried academic work takes, particularly in a moment with increased health risks and caretaking responsibilities. And while these tolls are felt by many within the academic context, they have certainly put additional strains on those whose positions were already precarious and who have long carried inequitable burdens within the labour spaces of the university, including women, and gender non-conforming people, Indigenous, Black, racialized diasporic, queer, trans, and disabled scholars. This session invites participants in a roundtable discussion who want to critically reflect and think through their own experiences of academic life within the pandemic, and want to envision other ways possible grounded in compassion and acknowledging the personal side of the professional.</p>

					<p>We generally work in institutions that address threats on a level of acknowledgment for management&mdash;where management means a return to normal&mdash;, while intentionally failing to address the psychological toll, disruptions to life, limits to resilience, health concerns, and emotional necessities to a life worth living. Universities make themselves places that use tacking &ldquo;real world problems&rdquo; as mere branding exercise, to draw in investors, but ultimately deny the threats and fail to make real changes as a result.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Dia da Costa</strong><span class="school">, University of Alberta</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>If recovery from burnout is usefully envisioned as compassion in the academy, I want to explore the challenge of knowing compassionate care when we see it, and its tenuous relationship to the reproduction of whiteness. Thinking from the standpoint of a dominant-caste South Asian in the North American academy, I foreground the coexisting historical structures of white supremacy and caste supremacy, in order to view them as collaborating engines that produce burnout for some and build empire for others within a highly-uneven academic environment. Resisting our part in reproducing the structural conditions for burnout I argue might begin with holding a mirror to dominant-caste South Asians who might readily recognize our burnout from experiencing white love in the academy. White love is different from but related to outright racist exclusion. White love feeds the racialized need to be seen, teetering on the edge of tokenism rather than announcing itself as such. Yet, white love ultimately treats the academy as a white possession (Moreton-Robinson); extractive in its relation to subjugated knowledges; serving individual empire-building; a key lubricant in the racialized patronage system that reproduces whiteness; and gaining traction in and through racialized complicity and assimilation. Dominant-caste complicity in white love suggests that resisting burnout should include noticing our willful misapprehension of our own practices of extracting from and possessing caste-oppressed peoples for our academic careers. Especially when our anti-caste work feels like care work, we could ask what forms of naturalizing compassion as dominant-caste affective property we might be reproducing.</p>

    				<p>Of the many things the COVID-19 pandemic threw into relief was the difficulty and, at times, impossibility, of trying to carry on with the academic work of administration, teaching and research while caring for and homeschooling children for extended periods of time. This was exacerbated by the inability for most universities to accommodate or even acknowledge the grossly inequitable position that many faculty were put in. Using my own experience parenting three small children while Chair of my department during the pandemic, I explore the burnout, anger and exhaustion I experienced while also trying to think through alternative ways that the institution might better support faculty who have children.</p>

		    		<h3><i>A Blanket Imperative for Rest</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Nikki Brasseur</strong><span class="school">, University of Winnipeg</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>There are numerous notions in scientific literature which consider how mental fatigue occurs; what demands create it, and what is needed to regenerate. But there is also significant metaphorical reference when speaking of rest and recovery. People often talk about 'recharging' their batteries, or 'refueling' their energy, clearly implying our bodies are a resource slowly being diminished by a capitalist culture of urgency. As a working graduate student with disabilities, I constantly multitask priorities which compete for my time and energy; pushing one thing out the door only to bend to the next.</p> 
					<p>Colonialism, capitalism, and white supremacy depend on the belief that we are our labour. By design, these systems are ableist, individualistic and hierarchical, basing success on ability, and driving the entire globe to exhaustion; exceptionally so within the BIPOC and disability communities. Being busy has become social capital and how our time is commodified is accepted as the status quo. As am someone who lives in daily pain, these experiences and the exploitation of my time are often downplayed as I appear able-bodied. Adding to metaphorizing of our bodies as a resource and there being a 'blanket' imperative for rest, I propose a tangible &lsquo;log&rsquo; of my time, patched together in a quilt. As transformational work takes time and energy, I am hoping to utilize this craft to visually address the nature of my time production and why there should be &lsquo;rest&rsquo; leave in academia.</p>
					<p>Research-creation is still not wildly accepted in the university space, therefor utilizing it with regards to a rest requirement in academia is not only an act of resistance but brings artistic literacies and methods together with theories in other disciplines in ways that confront traditional dissemination practices.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Dr. AJ Ripley</strong><span class="school">, St. Thomas University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>In May 2020, I defended my doctoral thesis online and was one of the first students at my institution to do so. I had never heard of Zoom before spending three hours in front of my computer screen fielding vague questions from a panel of (mostly) pixelated strangers.</p> 
					<p>For me, and many other trans people, the pandemic drove me further inwards. As a queer, gender diverse person with an auto-immune disease, I was no stranger to avoiding public spaces. However, I did not anticipate the emotional weight that would accompany the stillness that followed my graduation. At a time when I was supposed to be hustling to find positions and interviews, the world seemed to turn off. I felt forced to pivot my career plans and feared becoming increasingly obsolete with each passing day.</p>
					<p>My contribution to this panel will explore how disability justice principles have helped reframed my thinking both pedagogically and collegially, and how taking baths and talking with my academic friends on Instagram kept me alive during the early days of the pandemic. What I learned during my reflective hiatus from full-time immersion in the academy was that it had wounded me in many ways, and I will share how I am still healing the trauma of being good at a bad system.</p>
