		    		<p>Scholars and practitioners across a range of disciplines have shown that place matters for social life. Places have a distinct geographical location and material form. They are invested with meaning and value. Places are felt, perceived, understood, interpreted, narrated and imagined. Placemaking can solidify and perpetuate social hierarchies and differences, shape gendered, raced, and classed interactions, and reproduce power and privilege. Placemaking can be used to dominate people and nature, colonize, and exercise political power. It can also bring people together to create community, break down barriers, and create positive change. Focusing in particular on the intertwining of materiality, meaning, and the senses in making place, this panel invites academics and artists to examine how art and architecture across time and around the world transform space into place through processes that make space both meaningful and purposeful.</p>

		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Anna O&rsquo;Meara</strong><span class="school">, University of Victoria</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>&ldquo;Architecture is the understanding of the self (&hellip;) The final product of creation is the creator,&rdquo; argued Attila Kot&aacute;nyi in 1946. Kot&aacute;nyi argued that architecture expressed the architect&rsquo;s vision of the world, leading many architects to become so immersed in their imagination that they would neglect ethical questions about whether the spaces they were creating were fit for the betterment of human life. The debate surrounding architectural form and function led to, in both cases, architectures that did not benefit everyday human existence. Kot&aacute;nyi and the Situationist International looked to public housing projects by Charles-&Eacute;douard Jeanneret-Gris (Le Corbusier) as examples of attempted aesthetic beauty that was unlivable, and Georges Eug&egrave;ne Haussman&rsquo;s urbanism as functional architecture in the service of authoritarianism, to the detriment of human life.</p>
					<p>The places where people live have central significance to the lives of the people living there. As an alternative to modern architecture and urbanism, Kot&aacute;nyi looked to indigenous cultures in Australia and Siberia to consider how inhabitants rather than architects might define (for themselves) the centrality and significance of their own place, treating their homes as expressions of their personal lives and insular communal world. In order to extend possibilities in placemaking to incorporate the will of inhabitants, Kot&aacute;nyi and the Situationist International asked: what if architecture could be constructed with the intention of being manipulated by human choice?</p>

		    		<h3><i>Saintly Presence and Sacred Place: Sculpture and Experience in the Roman Oratory of S. Barbara</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Morgan Currie</strong><span class="school">, Carleton University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>The Oratory of St. Barbara next to the church of S. Gregario Magno in Celio in Rome was rebuilt by counter-Reformatory historian and apologist Cardinal Cesare Baronius in 1602 as part of his efforts to renew significant monuments of the early Church. The new construction preserved the triclinium or stone table that Pope St. Gregory the Great (r. 590-604) used to feed the poor, and where, according to legend, he was joined by an angel. This venerated object became the centrepiece of the new oratory, a material connection between past and present that, typical of Baronius&rsquo; historiography, asserts continuity across a gulf of time. However, it is the works of art surrounding the triclinium that make the oratory an interactive demonstration of post-Tridentine continuity with the early Church, and so transform its space into a meaningful place.</p>
					<p>Baronius&rsquo; project is historically important for its use of different media to construct corresponding aspects of an integrated, spatially-determined experience. The marble statue of St. Gregory the Great (c. 1602; marble, San Gregorio Magno, Rome) by Nicolas Cordier adds an ambiguous presence that combines tangible reality and abstracted ideality analogous to the saintly intercessor it depicts. Surrounding frescoes explicate the saint and his table with narrative scenes and figures whose two-dimensionality distinguishes them from the insistent materiality of statue and triclinium as more overtly referential. The assemblage is completed by the inclusion of the viewer as the contemporary end of a temporal continuum that connects them to Gregory and, through him, to the early Christian era. The material qualities of the sculpture and historical resonance of the site symbiotically create a place where Gregory&rsquo;s real past and an ever-changing present can coexist in sacred continuity.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Evan Pavka</strong><span class="school">, Wayne State University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>In 1920, artists Frances Loring and Florence Wyle (affectionately known as &ldquo;The Girls&rdquo;) purchased what was then an abandoned church-turned-school-house-turned-religious-meeting-ground in an undeveloped area of Toronto, Canada. In the intervening decades, the former Anglican Christ Church in Deer Park at 110 Glenrose Avenue became a significant node in the city&rsquo;s cultural an artistic milieu, cementing both Loring and Wyle as fixtures in the local imaginary. In the process, the pair turned the soaring ceilings into the prime site for the production of works while grafting on additions and interior renovations that reimagined the already appropriated structure anew as their home and studio. Widely publicized and discussed in local newspapers, the church became inseparable from their identities, domesticity and artistic practice &mdash; an architectural oddity mapped onto their own as elderly women who lived together, struggled off and on with poverty and worked in a neoclassical, figurative language. By examining how existing materials and building elements were strategically recontextualized and deployed throughout pair&rsquo;s fourty year stay, this paper takes up the series of architectural adaptations enacted by Loring and Wyle to their unconventional residence as queer tactics of appropriation and placemaking, asking: What role did such modification play in both masking and mediating their arguably queer life? How was space &mdash; and therefore place &mdash; central in shaping a highly visible but distinctly non-normative domestic environment in an otherwise protestant, conservative metropolis? Such an analysis may allow us to situate these quotidian histories of survival by non-architects as precursors to contemporary architectural discourses of adaptive reuse, sustainability and the more expansive histories of marginalized communities in these practices.</p>

		    		<h3><i>Moral Placemaking in Fourteenth-Century Italy</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Brian A. Pollick</strong><span class="school">, University of Victoria</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>One of the functions of art and architecture in the built environments of the cities and towns of fourteenth-century Italy was to infuse public and private spaces with moral meaning. This infusion served to transform these multifunctional spaces into moralized places which reinforced the behavioural conventions of hierarchy, obligation, and reciprocity that defined Italian civic life.</p> 
					<p>In addition to the fixed imagery that might address idealized civic/Christian behaviours and social relations, portable objects, such as illuminated manuscripts or painted panels, could also be used to transform commercial and social spaces into places of conscious moral interaction. In this presentation I will demonstrate how the content and materials of some imagery, when considered in context of the normative beliefs and social conventions of late-medieval civic society, functioned as moral placemakers.</p> 
					<p>In particular, I will show how the imagery in such public spaces as the grain market at Orsanmichele and the <i>Arte della Lana</i> guildhall in Florence achieved this objective. I will then look at how the external and internal imagery of the privately-owned Palazzo Datini, the purpose-built residence of Francesco Datini (1335-1410) of Prato, also served this moral placemaking role. I will conclude with an examination of how the use of a portable object such as the illuminated manuscript, <i>Lo specchio umano</i>, produced by the Florentine grain merchant Domenico Lenzi around 1340, might also have served as a moral placemaker.</p>

		    		<h3><i>Dwelling as landscape: a virtual project</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Paul Landon</strong><span class="school">, Universit&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec &agrave; Montr&eacute;al</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>Dwelling as landscape is a proposal for a new artwork that develops on the intersection of the perception of landscape with applications of imaging technologies. It is a project that imagines dwellings in natural landscapes and how these might be constructed and perceived. It builds from historical conceptual art practices where the artwork exists primarily as an idea and links these to recent approaches for sustainability in artmaking. This project incorporates technologies of digital imagery leading to the realisation of speculative artforms that reflect upon the notion of dwelling and its changing relationship to landscape, nature, and environment. As 3D line drawings, these forms recall architectural plans, projections of material forms in space, what is yet to be built.</p> 
					<p>This project extracts the notion of dwelling from the built environment and considers it as a perceptual activity that is not constrained by architectural norms and land ownership. It proposes the dwelling as a state of being with the landscape that can be re-imagined and envisioned using technological processes. Dwellings exist in the imagination as speculation but also as memory. They have endured historically and will continue to reappear in much of what we call landscape. Unlike sedentary settlements, dwellings often lack permanence, oscillating between being part of both built and natural space. Virtual objects will be used to draw attention to the environment in which they are inserted; inaccessible landscapes become settings for temporary homes, or dwellings. Computer generated, these open-ended structures reframe landscape as an immanent geography of perception and nature.</p>
