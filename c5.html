		    		<p>With the digital no longer an adequate term for describing the specificities of media art, this session seeks to question its histories and various nomenclatures since the 1960s&mdash;computer art, art and technology, electronic art, new media, contemporary media forms such as social media, games, and apps. Taking exhibitions like 9 Evenings (1966), <i>Cybernetic Serendipity</i> (1968), and <i>Software</i> (1970) as points of departure we believe systems art was synonymous with the then emerging field of cybernetics and the new technology of the computer. The dominant narrative of this history celebrates an explosion of interest in the 60s and early 70s, a disappearance through the remainder of the 20<sup>th</sup> C, and a recent return that is more slow burn than triumph. This session will pay particular attention to systems in the broadest sense including systems art. Given this framing, papers that embrace a more expansive approach to media art are welcome.</p>

		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Jane Tingley</strong><span class="school">, York University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>For this panel I will discuss my exhibition <i>more-than-human</i>. The exhibition presents media artworks at the intersection of art, science, Indigenous worldviews, and technology that speculatively and poetically use multimodal storytelling as a vehicle for interpreting, mattering, and embodying more-than-human ecologies. The works in the show aim to critically and emotionally engage with the important work of de-centring the human and rethinking the perspective that sees nature as a lifeless resource for exploitation. Many of the artworks use technological and scientific tools as entry points for witnessing and interacting with these more-than-human worlds, as they help visualize phenomena beyond human sensory perception while nevertheless situating us within them. Combined, the works in the show weave a story that tells a tale of symbiosis, intersections, and more-than-human relationality. The works combine scientific, philosophical, and Indigenous perspectives to create an experiential tapestry that asks the viewer to reconsider, reorient, and rethink relationships with the <i>more-than-human</i>.</p> 
					<p>Exhibiting artists include Ursula Biemann, Grace Grothaus, Lindsey french, Dolleen Tisawii&rsquo;ashii Manning + Mary Bunch, Suzanne Morissette, Joel Ong, Rasa Smite &amp; Raitis Smits, and Jane Tingley with Faadhi Fauzi and Ilze (Kavi) Briede.</p>

    				<p class="bio"><strong>Jane Tingley</strong> is an artist, curator, director of the Sympoietic Living Ontologies Lab (SLOlab) and Associate Professor at York University. Her studio work combines traditional studio practice with new media tools&mdash;and spans responsive/interactive installation, performative robotics, and telematically connected distributed sculptures/installations. Her works are interdisciplinary in nature and explores the creation of spaces and experiences that push the boundaries between science and magic, interactivity and playfulness, and offer an experience to the viewer that is accessible both intellectually and technologically. Using distributed technologies, her current work investigates the hidden complexity found in the natural world and explores the deep interconnections between the human and non-human relationships. As a curator her interests lie at the intersection art, science, and technology with a special interest in collaborative creativity as impetus for discovery. She has exhibited in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and has received support from a number of funding agencies, including the arts councils of Canada, Manitoba, Ontario, and Que&#769;bec, the Canada Council for the arts, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.</p>

		    		<h3><i>What is the &ldquo;Cyber&rdquo; in Cyberfeminism? Rethinking feminist art and technology in the 1990s</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Jen Kennedy</strong><span class="school">, Queen&rsquo;s University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>The precise origin of the term &ldquo;cyberfeminism&rdquo; is debated. It was used by Australian art collective VNS Matrix, British cultural theorist Sadie Plant, and Canadian artist Nancy Paterson nearly simultaneously but, by all accounts, independently, in the early 1990s as the internet and world wide web surged into public view. Over the next few years, it became a rallying point for a loose network of artist-activists with diverse and often conflicting investments in the relationship between feminism and technology, many of whom gathered for the first time IRL at The First Cyberfeminist International during the international art exhibition Documenta X in 1997. The discourses and artistic practices of cyberfeminism in the 1990s and early 2000s simultaneously reached backward and forward in time, stretching and adapting the cybernetic and feminist creative praxes of the three previous decades to the then-emergent techno-social formations of the internet. As uses of the term proliferated throughout the 2000s, however, &ldquo;cyberfeminism&rdquo; became increasingly separated from its art historical roots, and it has since been largely replaced by neologisms, including &ldquo;techno-,&rdquo; &ldquo;xeno-,&rdquo; and, recently, &ldquo;glitch&rdquo; feminism.</p>
					<p>This paper situates the self-described cyberfeminist artistic practices and networks that burgeoned in the 1990s and early 2000s within a longer history of cybernetic and systems art. In doing so, it argues for anker&rdquo; in &ldquo;cyberfeminism&rdquo; and, in turn, for an overdue reassessment of the historical and contemporary significance of cyberfeminist art.</p>

		    		<h3><i>&ldquo;A Clinical Video with Love:&rdquo; Vera Frenkel&rsquo;s</i> String Games <i>as the first Telematic Artwork</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Mikhel Proulx</strong><span class="school">, Queen&rsquo;s University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>In the autumn of 1974, Vera Frenkel staged the participatory artwork String Games: Improvisations for Inter-City Video. Utilizing the brand-new technologies of the Bell Canada Conference TV, Frenkel cast two groups of participants&mdash;five each in Toronto and Montreal&mdash;to play a remote version of the classic game cat&rsquo;s cradle. The results were what the journalist Henry Lehman called a &ldquo;clinical video with love.&rdquo;</p>
					<p><i>String Games</i> was the first artwork to use live, two-way, video-based telematics. However, art historical attention to the artwork has been insufficient, and the field of networked art history vastly underrepresents women artists. Art historical accounts of early telematic art usually&mdash;and erroneously&mdash;indicate the beginnings of the field in the years following String Games, a period that indeed saw the advance of telematic art. <i>String Games</i> stands apart as the progenitor in the field, and is in dialogue with those artworks better documented within media art historic canons, which focus predominantly on artwork in the 1980s, tend to canonize Americans, and are nearly exclusively the domain of men.</p>
					<p>This paper provides a technological and art historical analysis of <i>String Games</i>, situates its role within the history of networked art, and explores the artwork&rsquo;s co-operative realisation in the context of technological development in the Canadian nation-state. Decades before studies alerted us to the cognitive overload of Zoom fatigue and the importance of non-verbal, bodily signals in digital media, Frenkel and her collaborators used telematics to consider new ways of being together with and through embodying new communications tools.</p>
