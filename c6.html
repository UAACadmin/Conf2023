		    		<p>Stephen Eisenman has recently suggested that the essential question for art history today is whether the challenge of the Anthropocene&mdash;the epoch when earth systems have become so degraded that human survival itself is in doubt&mdash;demands a re-evaluation of the art and culture of the past, and even a reconsideration of current methods of scholarship. This session hopes to query what effect this pressing crisis has on our connections to historical objects and events from the early modern period (1400-1800) by focussing on the genre of landscape from an eco-critical perspective. Papers in this session focus on the material aspects of nature, &lsquo;naturecultures&rsquo;, gardening tools and images of cultivated landscapes, rural immersion and allegories of artmaking, land enclosure and violence, as well as colonial ecotourism in eighteenth-century India.</p>

    				<p>Developed and operated by human hands, tools shape the landscape.  My paper examines watering vessels in the European Early Modern Period as indicative of human interference with the natural landscape in both agricultural and aesthetic pursuit.  As well as archaeological evidence, the visual culture surrounding watering vessels suggests their role as symbols of &ldquo;cultivated&rdquo; landscapes (against &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo;) within the growing popularity of Early Modern garden culture.  I draw a key distinction between (modern) environmentalism and naturalness: while the collection of rainwater in a barrel, for instance, is environmentally friendly, it is also an unnatural process that manipulates the natural elements of earth and water.  My examples of watering vessels are drawn from archaeological artifacts, technical designs (both drawn and printed), and artistic depictions within narrative/portrait contexts.  Through these sources, I will recreate several watering vessels based on <i>chantepleure</i> (thumb pots with possible handles), watering pots (distinguished by spouts and roses), and watering barrel designs.  These recreations will allow me to consider the physicality and functionality of these tools, as well as what they can tell modern makers and audiences about interactions between &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; materiality in the landscape.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Timothy J. McCall</strong><span class="school">, University of British Columbia</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>In 1560, a group of Milanese humanists, artists, and poets, inaugurated the &ldquo;Academy of the Blenio Valley&rdquo;, an anti-academy that systematically inverted the bookish and urbane academies then appearing in Italian cities. Rather than Latin, they conducted meetings in an invented rural dialect, dressed as manual laborers, and drew caricatures derived from Leonardo&rsquo;s drawings of grotesque heads owned by an academy member. By studying and roleplaying as peasants, thought to live harmoniously with the natural world, they furnished and immersed themselves in a rural worldview as if to tap the unlimited creative potential of nature. A fascination with rural life and folk culture was sustained by its members after the academy ceased to exist. Art-theorist Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo published pastoral poems written in the academy&rsquo;s synthetic dialect. The academy&rsquo;s founder, engraver Ambrogio Brambilla published images of folk culture.</p> 
					<p>Over the next century, artistic subjects immersed in landscape like penitent saints wandering the wilderness and pastoral activity grew in popularity. In Salvator Rosa&rsquo;s proto-Romantic etching <i>The Genius of Salvator Rosa</i> (1668), a frenzy of foliage surmounted by cypress trees surrounds an auto-allegorical personification of artistic genius. A vivacious wreath sitting atop Genius&rsquo;s head links the abundance of the landscape to the fecundity of the mind. Like the Accademia della Val d&rsquo;Bregno, creative productivity is linked to what I call &ldquo;rural immersion&rdquo;. Rural immersion offers an alternative to the Archimedean point of the human subject beholding and constituting a panoramic Nature as its opposite. Immersion is instead a position <i>within</i> the rural landscape from which the production of ideas about nature and direct interventions with pre-existing ecologies, economies, and cultures can be staged. This paper explores rural immersion as an iconographic tendency in early modern Italy, connecting this <i>topos</i> to broader economic and political conditions surrounding, perhaps propelling, this pastoral turn.</p>

    				<p class="bio"><strong>Tim McCall</strong> studies early modern art theory and printmaking, in which intersections of global encounter and media revolution radically reformulated the concept and reality of &quot;human&quot;. His research explores how the early modern campaign to derive a notion of art through a (re)theorization of making alters the broader terrain of labor in entangled domestic and colonial contexts. He is interested in shifts in iconographic tendencies that reveal fundamental recharacterizations of body concept and the emergence of new subjectivities from the dense sea of early modern artifice churning with a mass infusion of word and image driven by publishing technologies and institutions.</p>

		    		<h3>They Ball-Beat their Swords into Ploughshares<i>: Picturing the Violent Fracturing of the Holistic Ecosystem in Early Modern Britain</i></h3>

    				<p>It has been widely acknowledged that the success of capitalism required a change in how humans understood and rationalized the non-human world in order to move from a system of subsistence to one of accumulation. Scholars have described this phenomenon in various ways, but generally it can be seen as a splitting or moving away from a pre-modern holistic worldview in which humans and non-humans co-exist within an interdependent ecosystem towards an early modern cartesian binary in which humans are the dominant species over the non-human world &ndash; thus allowing for aggressive exploitation of natural resources for profit. An important step towards participation within the English capitalist experiment was the privatization of common lands for personal gain. The legal concept of property was extended to include land and goods located on or taken from the land &ndash; including those produced by the land. Physical objects like houses, gardens, and barriers were built and dug into the landscape as signifiers of ownership. Patrons sought visual records of absolute ownership in the form of prospect paintings while the rise of illustrated DIY guidebooks demonstrate a heightened interest in land improvement and productivity. These early modern changes to the landscape were brutal and swift &ndash; profoundly impacting the way that rural working classes lived and thought of themselves within the world. This research examines how the early-modern English land enclosures that took place in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are represented in visual art as deliberate and violent actions that fractured the pre-modern holistic ecosystem worldview.</p>

		    		<h3><i>James Forbes and the Paradox of India</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Sarah Carter</strong><span class="school">, University of Chicago</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>Banyan trees and Hindu cave temples featured prominently in British depictions of India in the late eighteenth century. These exotic species and ancient spaces became &ldquo;primeval ciphers&rdquo; for a past that was perceived to have endured into the early modern era (Ray 2013). James Forbes&rsquo;s <i>Cubeer Burr</i>, <i>The Great Banyan Tree</i> (1790) [Fig. 1] and its pendant <i>The Temple of Elephanta</i> (1790) [Fig. 2] have been read in these terms&mdash;as picturesque or sublime visions of a wild and primordial India that British agents aspired to tame and &ldquo;improve&rdquo; through colonial management. This paper, however, shifts emphasis from aesthetics to ecology. I read Forbes&rsquo;s prints alongside his unpublished manuscripts and travelogue <i>Oriental Memoirs</i> (1813&ndash;1815) to illuminate how colonial agents negotiated the complexities of South Asian environments&mdash;at once hostile and wondrous. I argue that <i>Cubeer Burr</i> and <i>The Temple of Elephanta</i> are visual evidence not only of Forbes&rsquo;s heterogeneous lived experiences but also of a broader cultural paradox that evolved in tandem with Britain&rsquo;s expanding colonial reach: the fact that &ldquo;India&rdquo; recalled both an &ldquo;ever-flourishing garden&rdquo; (Czennia 2021) and diverse &ldquo;deathscapes&rdquo; (Arnold 2015) in British imaginations at home and abroad. Being attentive to this paradox allows us to make sense of the perplexing contrariness of a print like <i>Cubeer Burr</i> which suggests the pleasures of ecotourism even as it visually registers the dangers of the &ldquo;narrow glens, dark woods and impenetrable jungles&rdquo; that Forbes navigated in his role as a writer for the East India Company. Finally, the paper reflects on how early modern ideas about the natural world forged through colonial encounters have shaped our present, seemingly irreconcilable relationship with nature.</p>
