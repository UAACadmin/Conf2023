		    		<p>The Critical Image Forum (CIF) is an interdisciplinary research cluster and public humanities project at The University of British Columbia that focuses on issues related to photography and expanded documentary practice. In 2023-2024, CIF will initiate a SSHRC-funded public program, &ldquo;Archival Practices and the Networked Image,&rdquo; to develop, through an examination of the dynamics of image repositories, an understanding of how the temporality of images enables relationships to emerge between our current moment and its histories and possible futures.</p>
					<p>In her 2020 book <i>Photographic Returns: Racial Justice and the Time of Photography</i>, Shawn Michelle Smith proposes that there is a &ldquo;temporal recursivity&rdquo; that is &ldquo;intrinsic to photography, a backward and forward movement inherent to the medium that invites such returns.&rdquo; A recursive approach to photography engages the medium as bound to its representational outputs but displaces where truth value lies: the repetition, representation, or reenactment of the image (and redeployment of its techniques) over time. As such, the material and conceptual repositories in which photography resides&mdash;the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; archive and the &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; network&mdash;must also be rethought; CIF&rsquo;s 2023-2024 program offers an expansion and application of &ldquo;recursivity&rdquo; toward archival practices and networked images. Rather than assuming archives are the exclusive purview of the past, and networks of the future, the program is structured around the following questions: What tools can we deploy to critique networked culture and the mass image proliferation of the present through questioning the power structures embedded in technologies of image collecting? Can we build archives of the future through conscientious networked habits in the present? How can we understand historical migration networks as pathways for the distribution of images? How can connections between images telegraph meaning across time periods, helping to articulate relationships across past, present, and future spaces?</p> 
					<p>The 2023 UAAC conference will offer a platform to present the CIF&rsquo;s past, current, and future research and introduce (and generate) the local, national, and international projects that will be mobilized through the &ldquo;Archival Practices and the Networked Image&rdquo; program.</p>

    				<p>My current research surrounds the enduring presence of historical photographs as they are remobilized, reconstituted and circulated across different disciplines, institutions and platforms. The paper I propose for the Critical Image Forum panel on Archival Practices and the Networked Image will focus on my experience remotely researching the Black Star Collection of press photographs now housed at the Image Centre in Toronto, On., for a forthcoming publication. With the migration from newsroom archive to research centre, the identity and use of the collection was fundamentally changed and occurred as part of an ongoing trend to rescue or rehouse increasingly obsolete media languishing in &ldquo;photo morgues&rdquo; since the decline of print newspaper and magazine industries. With this migration, photographs that were once linked to specific moments easily become archetypes of larger movements, and the shift from physical archive to networked database has necessitated experimentation with different means of cataloguing, caring for and managing access to these images. My research on the Black Star Collection concerns one of these attempts made by the Image Centre to collaborate with a metadata company that merged crowdsourcing and machine learning to generate descriptive search terms more familiar to common Internet users than to professional archivists, academics or historians. Although driven by optimism and innovation, my research found that the terms generated by such systems &ndash; often opaque, perplexing and contradictory &ndash; tended to reflect and retain entrenched structural and societal biases, particularly in relation to photographs of BIPOC subjects.</p>

		    		<h3><i>The State of the World: Rehearsing an Abolitionist Reading Practice</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Hadley Howes</strong><span class="school">, Queen&rsquo;s University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>The Daguerreotype of <i>boulevard du Temple at noon</i> (1839) marks a monumental moment in the history of (what Ariella A&iuml;sha Azoulay calls) the &ldquo;imperial technology&rdquo; of photography. This image has been historically celebrated in the Western canon as documenting &ldquo;the first human being to be photographed&rdquo;: a &ldquo;man having his boots polished&rdquo; who stood still long enough for the seven-minute exposure to impress his image on the plate. Dionne Brand sees the photograph otherwise, however, writing in her poetry/essay <i>The Blue Clerk</i> (2018) that, in this image, she sees &ldquo;the state of the world.&rdquo; This vision of the image&ndash;the lived relations and intimacies that escape capture by the shutter&rsquo;s blades&ndash;is the counter-reading Brand challenges us to bring to the colonial archive.</p> 
					<p>Dylan Rodriguez describes an &quot;abolitionist reading practice&quot; as reading beyond what is immediately perceived to include the conditions under which the information emerges. If the conditions for the emergence of the Daguerreotype of the boulevard, and its inscription into the archive, are rooted in imperial powers that seek to know, possess, make and destroy worlds, then acknowledging and reckoning with these conditions is, according to Azoulay, a method of attending to &ldquo;the recurrent moment of original violence,&rdquo; and beginning to &ldquo;unlearn imperialism.&rdquo; Examining the conditions of meaning-making about the boulevard recorded in the archives of European and North American press reveals the kind of work these (white gentlemen) scholars wanted to do when they read the image in 1839, 1937, and yesterday. By following the traces of Brand&rsquo;s seeing and reading practices (given as poetry) alongside the archive of the photograph&rsquo;s history as a monumental artifact of imperial technology, this presentation rehearses an abolitionist reading practice that counters the sense-making project of Western aesthetics and transforms the world into what is, therefore, possible.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Maura Lucking</strong><span class="school">, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>In March 1922, the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs organized an industrial survey to report on the status of Native homes recently built on allotments&ndash;reservation lands subdivided into individual parcels. Outfitted with cameras to document their findings, agency superintendents observed subsistence industries and property improvements at these modern homesteads. It remains the most complete record of the nation&rsquo;s indigenous peoples near the height of their mistreatment and dispossession.</p>
					<p>The surveys track allottees&rsquo; parcel, age, blood quantum, citizenship, and family, along with commentary and a photograph of the house in question. Only occasionally were people pictured, strange given the detail captured about fluctuating or extended family members. I argue this tension between photograph and text is due to the discovery that expansive, multigenerational kinship networks persisted, despite allotment&rsquo;s intended disruptions to them. Focus on the self-built, single-family home as the primary referent upheld this assimilative biopolitical fantasy, despite the presence of contradictory information just out of frame.</p> 
					<p>Working from the <i>Waaswaaganing Ojibwe</i> survey, one of the most checkerboarded reservations, this paper analyses the contrast between settler aesthetics&ndash;balloon frame homes built from white pine lumber&ndash;and indigenous kinship&ndash;visitors caring for sick elders or making maple sugar with friends. One surveyor opined that, despite a new building, &ldquo;there are too many families and too many bosses in this home.&rdquo; I ask how this colonial archive exceeds the intentions of its makers and how its genre as an architectural photograph allows us to deconstruct the narratives of property, modernization, labor, and respectability the survey depends upon. The racialized aesthetics of these building &lsquo;portraits&rsquo; endure in real estate and home improvement media and timber framing remains valorized despite its devastating effects on forest ecologies and traditional artisanship. Today, digitized proxies are increasingly accessible to descendants and researchers in the vicinity of these homes; their logics of standardization, shared by the framed house itself, allow them to return now as evidence of ongoing indigenous lifeways rather than simply acculturation.</p>
