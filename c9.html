		    		<p>This panel examines the structure of karaoke as a decolonial method that recentres power within the body for systematic change. This is in one part an invitation to folks at this panel session to pick songs, and sing, to end colonization in Canada. This application of Karaoke as a method for picking songs puts singers into a new kind of relation with each other and the land. During the song offering Kilpatrick and Morin will present work on the importances of repurposing of popular love songs as  an embodied and collective critique and confrontation settler colonialism. <i>Love Songs to End Colonization</i> is also a double-vinyl album and performance art object that invites singers, listeners, bodies to understand how physical spaces are complicated by colonization. In this session, Morin and Kilpatrick will open up a space for singers, and listeners, to know that we are the love songs transformed by cross-ancestral collaboration and liberation. Karaoke being prioritized as a creative methodology that centres joy and kindness. Following along the work of scholars like Dylan Robinson, and Susan Blight, Kilpatrick and Morin, through this session, are inviting participants to sing a future, a future where everyone is invited to add their intention/spirit to the creation of a world that isn’t built on harming Indigenous bodies/territories/knowledges.</p>

    				<p>As a ubiquitous leisure activity in North America, karaoke has the potential to serve as a medium of cultural critique and social awareness. A brief historical context for this Japanese entertainment import will also include discussion of artwork that intersects with popular music from the <i>Love Songs to End Colonization</i> project from Peter Morin and Jimmie Kilpatrick, as well as artwork from the author will be reflected on and acknowledge karaoke as a means to explore cultural identities and build resilient community.</p>

    				<p>This talk reflects on my first encounter with Peter &amp; Jimmie&rsquo;s <i>Love Songs to End Colonization</i> (Dunlop Art Gallery in Regina, October of 2022). Drawing on Vanessa Machado de Olivera&rsquo;s conception of hospicing modernity, I interweave embodied memory, personal reflection, and a consideration of &ldquo;love as method&rdquo; &mdash; ambivalent, compromising, and unsettling.</p>

    				<p>There is a song in our family, and perhaps other Anishinaabe families, that goes, &quot;onzaam waasaa gidonji gichii wiichii namba&quot; which translates in English to &quot;you are too far away for me to be with you&quot;. In this talk, I analyze seemingly disparate practices of Ojibwe polyphonic sound from karaoke to travelling songs as gestures towards freedom, joy and the healing of grief.</p>
