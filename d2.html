		    		<p>In this panel I would like to bring together artists and scholars from various disciplines for a dialogue on epistemology, with the aim of developing a richer understanding of the relationship between art practice and academic research. Within this broad context, the panel would be oriented more specifically toward understanding the irreducible nature of the truths which artworks can communicate. As such, the practical outcome of the panel would be to further develop the language around the integration of creative practice into academic research, while explicitly resisting the expectation that the fruits of creative practice are always, if ever, reducible to academic language. Ultimately, I hope that this panel might serve to articulate new ways for &ldquo;interdisciplinary&rsquo; and &ldquo;research-creation&rsquo; models to be implemented in the university in an effort to ensure that the production of aesthetic truth is not subordinated by institutional default to the production of linguistic truth.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Lisa Wood</strong><span class="school">, Brandon University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>I am a figurative painter, and I believe in the power of images. I&rsquo;m driven by a desire to understand how people see themselves in the world; how art can facilitate connection and knowledge sharing to investigate collective and individual experiences with power, prestige, and exclusion. My research-creation pull comes from grappling to embody my story and the story of others through art making, social sciences and the humanities.</p>
					<p>Recognizing gaps in my knowledge and methodology, I&rsquo;ve sought out opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaboration to broaden my art practice by introducing qualitative research analysis. Through this I have experienced internal and external pressure to shape the language describing my art to speak more directly to academics and researchers, and felt the simmering stew of creative juices cooled off, dried up, or spat out by &ldquo;more serious&rdquo; researchers.</p> 
					<p>In this uncomfortable place I have turned to Natalie Loveless&rsquo; 2019 book <i>How to Make Art at the End of the World, A Manifesto for Research-Creation</i>. She describes research-creation within the context of Canadian universities and granting bodies as complex and messy, and advocates for connecting to the driving desire in your work (the Lacanian object petit a), while breaking down disciplinary boundaries. &ldquo;It requires that one cultivate a robust capacity to follow curiosity and sit with anxiety.&rdquo; (p.57)</p>
					<p>In this paper I ask, what is my &ldquo;object petit a&rdquo; in research-creation work? How can I maintain the integrity of my practice, while making room for possibility in the collaborative research process?</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>Positioned ambiguously between research and creation, a written thesis is a standard requirement of MFA programs globally. The allowances of form and purpose of the MFA thesis, however, vary from institution to institution. Is the MFA thesis a document that contextualizes, supplements, or illustrates the student&rsquo;s artistic work? Can the MFA thesis even subvert the role of explication while still fulfilling a programmatic expectation? How referential or tangential can the thesis be? This paper wishes to raise questions about the role and possibilities of the MFA thesis by surveying some select institutional guidelines while also looking at recent thesis examples ranging from the poetic to the academic.</p>

    				<p>What kinds of curatorial approaches invite art experiencers into the artistic process, so that they too might be transformed by the vitality of artistic research? How do these frameworks stimulate curiosities outside the academy, and with wider publics? Following the artists &ndash; to bend a slogan by Bruno Latour &ndash; is a tangential, rhizomatic, dialogic and transdisciplinary experience that frequently sends curators down the proverbial rabbit hole, particularly during the creation of new work. In my current doctoral research, artists&rsquo; references range from oral history and podcasts, ancient spiritualities and the occult, to psychedelia, soundscapes, collaborations with scientists, and lived experience.</p>
					<p>For this panel, I will workshop my current research-creation exhibition, <i>Resonance &lt;&gt; Consonance</i>, which focuses on artists from minoritized perspectives who are sensing otherwise towards embodied ways of knowing, feeling, and remembering &ndash; and how these approaches resonate across somatic and spiritual practices, neuroscience, decolonization and healing. I will also discuss past curatorial methodologies to illustrate the non-linearity and rich academic potential of artistic research. Drawing from Rosi Braidotti&rsquo;s critical and nomadic post-humanist approach, Laura U. Marks&rsquo; theorization of soul assemblages, and the development of concepts in my own curatorial practice, I maintain that artistic research is the fertile littoral between disciplines that will evolve human and other-than-human knowledges to greater potential. How to translate artistic research in accessible ways that convey its vitality, and create language that validates subjective, speculative, and experimental theories of knowledge, is key.</p>

    				<p>Ventriloquizing Michel Foucault&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;I am not a [en retraite] retired activist who, today, would like to re-enter the service. My mode of work has not changed very much; but what I expect from it is that it will continue to change me&rdquo; (35). Neither am I a retired artist. Yet I must say that I do stumble upon the phrase: mode of work. Is it permissible for me to state that mine has not changed very much? My answer shifts, depending on whether &ldquo;mode of work&rdquo; means &ldquo;method,&rdquo; or rather something like a &ldquo;mode of address.&rdquo; </p>
					<p>I will sport a kind of reading that is &lsquo;shot through&rsquo; by &lsquo;the trajectory&rsquo; of a meditative observational training derived from Bataillean endeavors as well as &lsquo;the coming and going&rsquo; or &lsquo;entering and falling out of composition&rsquo; marked by Foucauldian moments/sites/scenes/nexuses. Paraphrasing Dubilet on Bataille, I &ldquo;[seek] to question the intransigent boundaries established to render those discourses [academic research and artistic practice] distinct, self-sufficient, and polemically antagonistic to each other (151). I doubt that although presented as solution &mdash; field or shield? &mdash; research-creation serves the purpose it thinks it does as it is imagined against the backdrop of institutional formats.</p>  
					<p>I will pursue a speculative study of the ways in which transfeminist, antiracist, anti-capitalist and anti-colonial processes of invention shift between modalities and targets, how they bind/anchor, &lsquo;leave off&rsquo; and &lsquo;break with&rsquo; ontology and/or epistemology. And I will theorize how they take care of the &lsquo;nexus&rsquo; between bodies and institutions.</p>

		    		<h3><i>Not Knowing as Making</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Donna Szo&#779;ke</strong><span class="school">, Brock University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>As a mid-career artist and an Associate Professor of Studio Art, I am dumbfounded, thrilled, and delighted that my creative process begins with a central inscrutable impulse: I begin by not knowing what it is I am doing. Leaning further into my own process, the leap into the unknown is steered by a fuzzy intuitive sense of exploration, an unknown attraction, a sensing of what is present, potent, or desiring to become. This vague guiding principle has driven my art practice, yet intuition, speculation and other forms of innate knowledge are frowned upon as legitimate scholarly methodology.<sup>[1]</sup> Artist-scholars model that making is thinking &ldquo;in its own right&rdquo;.<sup>[2]</sup> Making art must be conjoined with a type of thinking, an intuitive not-knowing, to foster creative output. Art practice arises from experiential processes that are uncaptured by cognition yet stemming from affect.<sup>[4]</sup></p> 
					<p>The Social Sciences and Research Council of Canada definition of research-creation doesn&rsquo;t fully encompass the needs and processes of artist-scholars and other research-creationists.<sup>[6]</sup> Multiple modalities for research-creation exist including research-for-creation, research-from-creation, creative presentations of research, and creation-as-research.<sup>[8]</sup> My approach to research-creation most closely resembles creation-as-research and centres making as knowing, or more precisely, not knowing as making, and does not relegate artworks as secondary to scholarly text. Art making &ldquo;creates the conditions for new ways of encountering study&mdash;forms and forces of intellectuality that cut across normative accounts of what it means to know&rdquo;.<sup>[9]</sup> Not knowing as making invites, celebrates, dwells in the spaces that are not problems to solve, or absences to overcome, but fuel for studio practice: &ldquo;failure, boredom, frustration and getting lost...wonder, secrets and play&rdquo;.<sup>[10]</sup> How do I articulate my performance of not knowing as a form of thinking through making? How do we preserve the right to not know, to use not knowing as a foundational tenet of creative enquiry?</p>
