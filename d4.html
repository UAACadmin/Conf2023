		    		<ul>

    				<p>The freestanding Roman arch, conventionally a &ldquo;triumphal&rdquo; arch, is one of the most iconic monuments of the ancient world. During the imperial period (1-5c CE), over 800 arches were commissioned throughout the Mediterranean (F&auml;hndrich 2005). The earliest arches (&ldquo;fornices&rdquo;) were constructed in Rome during the Middle Republic (3-2c BCE). Set up by victorious generals who were denied the celebration of a Triumph (a vital socio-political milestone for elite males), these arches are conventionally decoded as pious &ldquo;votive&rdquo; monuments, constructed to honor the gods (Kleiner 1985; DeMaria 1988). Traditional narratives identify Augustus, Rome&rsquo;s first emperor, as the originator of the militarily-charged and self-aggrandizing triumphal arch.</p>
					<p>This paper reconceives the early Roman arch as a fundamentally hubristic monument, deliberately designed to replace the official, but ephemeral, Triumph. I argue that early patrons manipulated established systems of triumphal honors and manubial building to construct monuments that glorified themselves and their families. Set at significant urban nodes along the triumphal route, these arches acted as massive statue bases, raising gilded images of their patrons high above other honorific statues of ancient Rome. Their design was innovative: the form replicated the <i>Porta Triumphalis</i>, the sacred gate through which only victorious armies could pass, while their permanence and position forced triumphal generals to parade past, or even through, arches adorned with the glittering statues of rivals. These self-aggrandizing origins are critical to post-antique conceptions of arches as symbols of both imperialism and individual military exceptionalism, today still echoed from New Delhi, to New York, to Pyongyang.</p>

		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Luke Pardy</strong><span class="school">, NSCAD University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>My proposed paper addresses the hubris of Manifest Destiny and the settlement of the West. This paper draws upon my MFA thesis research, which seeks to understand the act of settler migration toward &ldquo;utopian land&rdquo; and imagined place in relation to &ldquo;the expansion of the west&rdquo;. This research is informed by my own inherited family histories and understanding of how I am implicated in the legacy of Manifest Destiny.</p> 
					<p>My research is based on an awareness that imbedded colonization and settlement is a compulsory sense of yearning for more. It explores a myth that a better life is waiting just over the next mountain or valley. I frame the settlement of the western United States and Canada as an attempt at Utopia. I will bring together these perspectives to look at the hubris of Manifest Destiny and how the equally compulsory artforms of photography and performance can challenge understandings of settlement.</p>
					<p>I will present this paper with an accompanying slide show, which will show how my current research and studio practice engages with, and challenges historic perspectives. In addition, I will also elaborate on how I have intentionally challenged hubris through performance by incorporating an anti-pilgrimage narrative as part of my research-creation process.</p>

    				<p>In August 2024 I will return to the Arctic for the fourth time. In 2017/2018 I attended two residencies in Svalbard&mdash;one aboard a barquentine ship, another at the world&rsquo;s northernmost contemporary art gallery, where I returned for a solo exhibition. Svalbard has no historical Indigenous human population, but for 500 some years humans have exploited its natural resources (whales, bears, coal, tourism etc.). Next year, I will conduct several self-designed and given instructions for performance, documented to photo and video, addressing the dissonances and complexities of Arctic touring during a time of ecological crisis, employing processes that meaningfully examine the value of my own power, privilege, and subject-position. I paused for a heartbeat before committing to return to this fragile part of the planet. But I will go, and both confront and address my own environmental impact (while attempting to avoid making didactic eco-art). My performances will leverage both humour and humility (eg. hosting a ship-board karaoke event; being the world&rsquo;s northernmost roller skater), but not be pure whimsy. Self-deprecation and absurdity will be important rhetorical tools for me. This summer I will be inviting close to 100 artists and curators to contribute instructions for me to perform. Invitees are not random, but those with whom I have shared tender and critical exchanges about art, memorial, elegy, witness, mortality, pathos, and, yes hubris. In Banff, I wonder if I can expand upon my thinking and planning, and possibly deconstruct some of the instructions I will have received by then?</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Tanya Klimp</strong><span class="school">, University of Alberta</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>Fast-food: instant gratification for hunger. Fast-food: a commodity that has velocity, distance and mass, lacing the planet with franchises and weighty carbon footprint. Fast-food: perhaps one of the most powerful symbols of humans&rsquo; dominance on this planet. Fast food wrappers are representative of consumerist society and its associated hubris. By unpacking these ubiquitous wrappers, we may better discuss the impact of hubris on individuals, communities, and the environment.</p> 
					<p>As part of the pantheon of global visual culture, the wrappers act as a calling-card for imperial-settler hubris. They are loaded with an explicit purpose, but silently contain other conversations. The printed burger wrapper is a 20<sup>th</sup> century prodigy, birthed from capitalist ideals. The intrinsic nature of fast-food restaurants is to conquer, as seen in the number of franchises globally, stock value, control of resources (even those of other sovereign nations), food addictions in the populace etc. These companies follow an exceptionalist model of ever increasing production. A moderate level of success is not enough. It is about control.</p> 
					<p>My interest in fast-food wrappers is to haptically explore these by-products. I embroider onto them in a slow attentive manner. Questioning both the habit and habitus that initially created them but seeing how they in turn frame the aforesaid. Reframe, zoom in, reframe, zoom in. These thin skins of consumerism are both media (as material matter) and medium (as something that is spoken through). In my art practice I disrupt the process, inverting the wrappers with conversations about the hubristic nature of consumerism.</p>

    				<p class="bio">Hello. My name is <a href="https://www.blackartifex.com/" target="_blank">Tanya Klimp</a>, and I am a Masters of Fine Arts painting candidate at the University of Alberta. I consider myself a maker, and I love the materials and my tools. Experimenting with unconventional items has been rewarding. In terms of art, if I were to distill and define my investigation &mdash; it would be best labeled as Form and Content. I am interested in questioning what constitutes either of those, what relevance they contain and why, in seeking new possibilities, and opening discourse around them. I have environmental, feminist and socialist concerns. I co-parent and collaborate with my queer partner to raise our two teenage children. He is also an artist (working on his own Masters concurrently!). I enjoy Donna Haraway&rsquo;s sympoeisis and tentacular thinking, Jane Bennett&rsquo;s &lsquo;thing&rsquo; agency, Roland Barthes&rsquo; myth-making, Julia Kristeva&rsquo;s embracing the abject, Deleuze and others' conversations about decentralized connectivity or algorithm theory.</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>Delves into Ludmila Lima de Morais' captivating projects, <i>Second Sun</i> and <i>Wind Symphony</i>, within the intriguing context of hubris in visual culture. Here the artist explores notions of utopia, exceptionalism, habitus, and beyond.</p> 
					<p>The project <i>Second Sun</i> introduces a robotic sunflower that dynamically follows viewers using facial recognition technology. Ludmila's creation, comprising a Raspberry Pi 4, servo motors, a USB camera, and an OpenCV face tracking code, symbolizes humanity's desire to be the center of nature. However, the project also raises important questions about the potential surveillance of immigrants, revealing the complex relationship between humans, nature, and technology. With these interactions, Ludmila sheds light on the darker aspects of our reliance on technology and our impact on the natural world.</p>
					<p>Inspired by personal experiences, <i>Wind Symphony</i> explores sound's transformative power. Ludmila's 3D environment, constructed using the Unreal Engine, immerses participants in a post-apocalyptic dreamscape featuring floating windows, pine trees, and spinning wild grass flowers. By collecting wind howling sounds and creating a personalized wind symphony, the project challenges preconceived notions of fear and anxiety associated with the wind. This artistic endeavor aims to shift perceptions, turning the sound of the wind into a source of beauty, creativity, and wonder. Simultaneously, <i>Wind Symphony</i> underscores the importance of our relationship with nature, reminding us of the fragility of our planet and the urgency to preserve it for future generations.</p>
					<p>Ludmila's art traverses the intersection of technology and humanity, illuminating the complex dynamics and consequences of this relationship. By creating a sense of unease, her work prompts viewers to contemplate the implications of our treatment of nature and reliance on technology.</p>
