		    		<p>To frame research-creation as new and innovative risks crucial institutional amnesia. For historically marginalized folks, research-creation is, and has been, a political tactic and a push for creative freedom. If white supremacist and heteronormative policies create structural barriers for multidisciplinary artists, then the visual culture of difference across Black and Brown diasporas challenges the status quo. For example, in the 1980s, the UK Black Arts Movement witnessed artists like Eddie Chambers and Sunil Gupta curating and writing on art and difference&mdash;which they did out of necessity. This roundtable is inspired by under-recognized histories of research-creation like these. We understand the legacy of research-creation as open and embodied. By centering practitioners of colour, this roundtable emphasizes an approach to research-creation that disrupts institutional conventions. We invite artists, curators, and scholars of colour to discuss their current practice and their relationship to the visual culture of difference.</p>

    				<p>When SSHRC introduced a pilot program for research-creation in 2000, those of us working and producing in the arts felt this was a boon, a recognition and validation within the tri-council realm that brought creative practice into the fold. As an early recipient of a research-creation grant, I was able to convert a novel into a participatory, multidisciplinary installation, a space where I could explore diasporic realities in the Parsi community and share them in alternative manners across the country. Early success in the RC program by racialized artist-researchers brought us to the cusp of reframing creative work, presented and exhibited in languages that were not alien or obfuscated by ivory tower gates, and this held promise. As the program developed, from pilot to an independent program to an integration of RC within the larger framework of SSHRC, however, what we began to see was a reversion to disciplinary norms and standards, oftentimes where RC became a one-page add-on or clickbox instead of an integral part of the method and outcome of a research project. Point of fact, I just finished my first tour of duty as a fine arts SSHRC panelist, and I was alarmed at the relative lack of diversity amongst the jurors, and further, the relative lack of uptake of RC projects by BIPOC folks. This presentation will explore how racialized artist-researchers might create support networks and share their work with each other to encourage, mentor, and sustain strong socio-political research creation practices. This presentation draws on a recent research-creation project printing photographs of kozo harvesting in Japan directly onto the high-end washi that is made through the kozo harvest.</p>

		    		<ul>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>Long before its institutionalization as a line of funding by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), research-creation has always been an alternative mode of knowledge and cultural production that marginalized practitioners have had to create, engage in, and sustain in order to be legible and pull through in academic, community, and artistic spaces. Artificial disciplinary boundaries have rarely served marginalized artists and their communities, especially with regards to expressing their lived experiences of difference in mainstream art festivals. Difference &ndash; in the form of race, age, gender, citizenship, and class &ndash; are brought to the fore in the 2019 Toronto Nuit Blanche intervention entitled &quot;Visualizing the East Side&quot;. This was a series of installations produced by students from Scarborough, many of whom were first- and second-generation immigrants and part of the Asian diaspora. By closely examining this case, I argue that youth-led research-creation collaborations not only upend widely held conventions of excellence and modernist notions of the artistic genius, but also undo traditional art world hierarchies of discipline and expertise. By carving out spaces for interdisciplinary youth expression and bringing the culture and knowledge of racialized suburban youth to the center, research-creation embraces its emancipatory ambitions to level the unequal power dynamics inherent in many research and art institutions. This presentation asks: <i>how can research-creation disrupt conventional understanding of art, &ldquo;the artist&rdquo;, research, and the contemporary art festival? How can interventions such as &quot;Visualizing the East Side&quot; produce more equitable art worlds?</i></p>

    				<p>As a Canadian from the South-Asian diaspora, I am working to form decolonial methods as an artist and curator, working across the disciplines of art and design. I am interested in thinking about modes of representation, how we consider &ldquo;value&rdquo;, and destabilizing how ideas of art, craft, and design have been determined by Western methodologies and definitions of high and low art. With my studio practice being centered on drawing, I turn to the poet/saint/weaver Kabir, who I consider as a site from which to approach mark-marking as an accumulation or a community/collective. With two strands of my practice &ndash; one being quite solitary in terms of making handmade paper and drawing &ndash; the other being in a skill-sharing and collaborative process working with wood block carvers and block printers in Kutch, Gujarat, I am wanting to find new processes for image-making. These research and methods of making are not simply voluntary, but because there is no choice: as a BIPOC artist I have to find material significance and resonance that can communicate a wider viewpoint of the colonial and post-colonial landscapes of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, which are interconnected through dyes like indigo, materials like jute, or craft skills like block printing. The larger aim is to insert locations as well as navigate away from those histories of art that were never intended to include someone like me beyond anthropological and ethnographic structures of classification, consumption or trade.</p>
