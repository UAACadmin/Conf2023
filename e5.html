		    		<p>What do low-residency MFA programs impact disability-identifying individuals? Low-residency MFA programs, combining online learning with intensive in-person sessions, are a growing trend in studio-art education. Scholarship indicates that they provide opportunities to diverse communities (Hart, 2012; Giltft-Swan, 2017; Durak and Canakaya, 2022; LeBoef, 2018). While there is a clear interest in these programs amongst recent Canadian BFA graduates (Leblanc 2020), a comprehensive understanding of how they impact disability-identifying individuals needs to be established (Kent, 2015). Cross-constituency dialogue focusing on andragogical and geragogical contexts is key to creating accessible online learning environments. (Bulbul et. al, 2022; Kent, 2015). Our international working group of researchers and graduate students experienced in low-residency art education, invite conference attendees to participate in a 40-min collaborative discussion session considering the impact of low-residency MFA programs for disability-identifying communities. Our group will present the results of our research and consultation at the UAAC Conference in 2024.</p>

    				<!--<p>In its maritime imagery, France expressed the most crucial condition of its empire. Without maritime trade and travel, France could not have built a colonial and economic empire during the long eighteenth century. Seafaring underpinned France&rsquo;s newly global commerce. However, the pictorial expression of this history is by no means simple. The slippage between real and fictive, aesthetics of verisimilitude and idealism, along with the professional impulses to both replicate and innovate, all characterize the marine paintings
and objects of France&rsquo;s ascension to world power and the distant artistic ripple effects in the middle of the eighteenth century that I explore in this paper. A crucial intersection of maritime scenes, topographical drawings and the formation of the French empire are present within Claude-Joseph Vernet&rsquo;s (1714&ndash;1789) Ports of France series and later disseminated engravings. The series transmutation and reception outside France is evident by the existence of Jean Patricio Morlette Ruiz&rsquo;s painted copies of the series along with Ruiz&rsquo;s novel views of Mexico City. This paper explores the category as defined by Vernet, the changes in perception of global economic ecosystem and the image of the port as a locus of political power throughout the globe for artists like Ruiz. By reframing these types of marine works through interdisciplinary methods pioneered in the fields of postcolonial and landscape studies this paper hopes to elucidate an overlooked genre and its global afterlives.</p>
