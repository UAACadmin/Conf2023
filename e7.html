		    		<p>There is something mad about every play space. Ludology teaches us that play itself can often look &ldquo;mad&rdquo; out of context, but within the social construct of any given play-world there are delicate systems and norms guiding our behaviour. It is within these magic circles where new subversive ideas and relationalities can be explored among players&mdash;we see these in everything from performance art to improv to clown to the design of games and playgrounds. Understanding how our play spaces can not only benefit from a neurodiversity paradigm but in fact rely on it for radical creation is critical in an age of increased interactivity and interpassivity. The methods and tools in this workshop are suited to performers, directors, performance designers, game designers, and any artist yearning to create (or critique) participatory art.</p>

		    		<h3>A.1.1 <i>&ldquo;Alone Between the Boundless Ocean and the Boundless Sky&rdquo;: Flora Tristan&rsquo;s Travel Accounts as Political Activism</i></h3>

    				<p>Perhaps best known to art historians as Gauguin&rsquo;s grandmother, Flora Tristan was an important mid-century feminist, union activist, and author of several volumes of travel writing. Published in 1838, <i>Peregrinations of a Pariah</i> is an autobiographical account of her year-long trip from France to Peru in 1833-34 and <i>Promenades in London</i> (1840) detailed her travels closer to home. Mary Louise Pratt&rsquo;s foundational work on travel writing has shown that the genre was, unsurprisingly, gendered and linked to imperialism, but Tristan&rsquo;s work is unusual in that it is through her travel writing that she developed and spread her nascent political philosophy. Prevented from inheritance from her Spanish-Peruvian father because of her status as illegitimate and unable to divorce her scoundrel husband, Tristan&rsquo;s travels and resultant books were motivated by financial necessity caused by legal injustice. Yet she turned these personal challenges into a cogent critique of capitalism, employing the comparative method to address issues which might otherwise have been censored in France&rsquo;s July Monarchy. Her interest in the global status of women&rsquo;s rights led to a wider critique of capitalism. She drew parallels between the status of women under capitalism and its reliance on a system of racialized enslavement, and this led her to concern with worker&rsquo;s rights more broadly conceived. In 1843 she published her most politically radical work, <i>The Worker&rsquo;s Union</i>, which called for a single universal worker&rsquo;s union open to all proletariat. To gain adherents to her utopian vision, she embarked on a solo tour of France, but died of typhoid while on tour, and thus her politicized travel writing from this trip was not published in her lifetime. Nevertheless, Tristan&rsquo;s important work shows the potential of travel writing as a genre open to women and potentially linked to political activism.</p>

Her recent book, <i>Diversity Counts: Gender, Race, and Representation in Canadian Art Galleries</i> (MQUP 2019) showed the importance of data-driven analyses in creating more just representation in Canadian museums. Earlier work focused on French anarchism in the nineteenth century and has been published in the <i>Art Bulletin</i> and elsewhere.</p>
