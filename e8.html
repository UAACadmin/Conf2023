		    		<p>Each year, the Art Canada Institute (ACI) awards up to five fellowships to support emerging scholars researching an artist or topic overlooked in Canadian art history. Over the course of one year, ACI fellows are mentored by preeminent scholars in their chosen field and produce a body of research that is prepared for publication with ACI. Learn more about how to join our dynamic community committed to rewriting the narrative of Canadian art for the twenty-first century. In this session, the program&rsquo;s directors will provide more information about the Fellowship, including eligibility criteria and how to apply.

    				<p>Through memory, close study, and experimentation, Martha James, Adeline Lorenzetto, Mary Peters, and Anabel Stewart brought the disrupted practice of Coast Salish (Salish) wool weaving back into the public eye at sites like the Place Bonaventure Hotel in Montreal in 1967. The resurgence of Salish weaving that they generated is the focus of my ACI fellowship research. These four Indigenous women from Sto&#769;:l&#333; territory (Chilliwack, BC) translated customary weavings into contemporary forms based on memory, photographs, and archival sources, regenerating an art form that was silenced by colonial disruptions of Salish daily life. Their journeys began in the early 1960s with the allegiance of local farmer and lay historian, Oliver N. Wells. Their experimentation produced prize-winning woven artworks and functional forms that were displayed and sold at craft fairs across Canada. Their weavings&mdash;rugs, wall hangings, chair covers and saddle blankets, to name a few&mdash;along with the interest developed through Wells&rsquo; 1966 publication in <i>The Beaver</i>, resulted in the first commission of Salish weaving for the art public installation in Montreal. Just like the whereabouts of those six massive weavings, the names of the makers of many Salish weavings located in museum and gallery collections remain undocumented, whether they are from the nineteenth or the twentieth century. My research aims to change the discourse of Canadian art history by (re)cognizing Salish weaving as the intellectual work of valued knowledge holders in Salish communities. Forms of marginalization that have disregarded Salish weaving&rsquo;s presence as an art form are presented and discussed, along with the conceptual complexities embedded in the weavings. Research processes and my work with archival materials, museum collections, and the descendants of weavers are foregrounded in an analysis of the resurgence of Salish weaving in the 1960s.</p>

    				<p class="bio"><strong>Alison Ariss</strong> is a PhD candidate in art history at UBC, an Art Canada Institute Fellow, and a UBC Public Scholars Initiative Fellow. She earned her MA in art history at UBC and holds a BA Honours in anthropology from Waterloo. As a settler-scholar, Alison views her research as an (un)learning process informed by Indigenous feminist theories. Her research centres Musqueam, Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, and St&oacute;:l&#333; knowledge in the analyses of public art installations of twenty and twenty-first century Salish weavings. Prior to graduate studies, Alison worked in research proposal development and management at the University of Winnipeg, Western, McMaster and UBC. She volunteered with the UBC Museum of Anthropology for the <i>Fabric of Our Land</i> exhibition in 2017-18 and held a special curatorial internship at the Morris and Helen Belkin Gallery in 2019-20. She has published in the <i>Journal of Textile Design Research and Practice</i> and her work is forthcoming in <i>RACAR</i>&rsquo;s research-creation special edition. Her research interests include museum studies, feminisms, public art, and the critique of institutions.</p>
