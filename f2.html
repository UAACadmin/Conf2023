		    		<p>This session solicits reflections on the links between emotion and disaster or ruins in the histories of art, design, urbanism, and visual culture more broadly. From Romantic meditations on ancient fragments of sculpture or architecture, to dramatic evocations of disaster (natural or human-made) in art, to debates on the fate of ruined buildings, to acts of intentional destruction and their reception, to fears of impending climate disaster: how have feelings &ndash; anger, fear, ecstasy, sadness, outrage, despair, love, admiration, hope, and more &mdash; been mobilized, represented, or otherwise engaged by artists, architects, and audiences in response to disaster and ruins? Presentations dealing with any aspect of this topic are encouraged, from any historical period, medium, or theoretical perspective.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Rachelle Sabourin</strong><span class="school">, McMaster University</span></li>	
		    		</ul>
    				<p>In June 1992, the new SoHo Guggenheim Museum of Art opened its first exhibition, featuring Carl Andre. The works were acquired three years before the opening, and less than 10 years after his wife Ana Mendieta&rsquo;s untimely death. At the opening, the Women&rsquo;s Action Coalition held a banner that read &ldquo;Carl Andre is in the Guggenheim. Where is Ana Mendieta?&rdquo; Mendieta&rsquo;s death, and the answer to this lingering question, have unsatisfying conclusions. As Jane Blocker writes in her text, <i>Where is Ana Mendieta?</i> &ldquo;Remembrance is a process, not a task to be completed.&rdquo;In this paper, I consider approaches to active remembrance and permanence in the light of violent absence. Mendieta&rsquo;s visceral artworks often make visible the absence of the body, of a person once removed. Eerily indicative of her own passing, Mendieta&rsquo;s land art, photography, and performances evoke her own commemoration - only mirrored by the activist art groups who continue to ask &ldquo;Where is Ana?&rdquo; in the spaces occupied by Andre. By engaging with both Mendieta&rsquo;s work and the protest work of groups such as the No Wave Performance Task Group, the Women&rsquo;s Action Coalition, and the Guerilla Girls, this paper will consider the power of the public gallery as an active memorial site. By mourning the dead in the physical exhibitions of those (allegedly) responsible, protestors and visitors refute the expected interiorizing of the &ldquo;other&rdquo; and instead display publicly their grief, in active pursuit of remembrance.</p>

		    		<h3><i>Considering Photographs of Ruins as the Material Culture of Dreams</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Susan A. Crane</strong><span class="school">, University of Arizona</span></li>	
		    		</ul>
    				<p>One historian&rsquo;s dream, 2022: a couple has a lot of goods for sale, all of them old and decrepit, and I am expected to buy the lot. But I am in a group of people, each of whom is attracted to different items, so I decide to make an offer based on what each person is willing to pay for one or two things. It&rsquo;s time to pay the couple. Should I pay for the whole lot (I will be making a profit) or ask for each item to be sold individually?</p>
					<p>I realize that each item has a story or meaning attached to it, which has drawn the buyer to it. The story is what makes it valuable (dreaming, I realize I&rsquo;ve made this point in writing so I&rsquo;m drawing on my own archive as well as memories of every time I&rsquo;ve had this thought). Each item supports possible stories. Each is a fragment of the past; we never have the whole lot, and each of us wants different pieces, ruins of the never-intact past.</p>
					<p>I wake up in the midst of the sale.</p>
					<p>Thinking about ruins as the material culture of dreams requires not only letting go of singular or homogeneous historical narratives (&ldquo;the lot&rdquo;) but contextualizing heterogenous, changing meanings and reaching across disciplines for critical support.  I propose looking at mid-19th-century photographs of ruins as material objects upon which dreams, histories, memories and other stories about the past have been inscribed, resisted and revised &ndash; and which can speak for themselves.</p>

		    		<h3><i>Commodifying Tragedy: Contemporary Souvenirs to Commemorate Difficult Knowledge</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Christopher Moore</strong><span class="school">, Concordia University</span></li>	
		    		</ul>
    				<p>Souvenirs invoke powerful symbolic representations of regional identities, histories, and events, propagated when tourists purchase and experience these evocative artifacts. They commemorate and confirm encounters with unfamiliar landscapes, cultural rituals, and distinctive artistic practices, but they also have emotional resonance. Frequently, souvenirs present narrow or superficial understandings of regional identity that can prevent certain communities from feeling welcome&mdash;a contentious situation in a world with rising nationalistic tensions.</p>
					<p>As sociologist Zygmunt Bauman asserts, &ldquo;[Tourists] pay for their freedom; the right to disregard native concerns and feelings, the right to spin their own web of meanings.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> If the typical function of souvenirs is to commemorate and memorialize personal and collective histories, could we not envisage contemporary forms that move beyond the grand narratives of regional and national identity? Can we speculate on new forms of souvenirs and representations that challenge the typical souvenir genre? Contemporary souvenirs have the potential to subvert existing phenomena or present new perspectives on culture and identity, depicting difficult knowledge and historical events. Representations of tragedy and trauma merit equal attention to those of Mounties, beavers, or scenic vistas. Je me souviens.</p>
					<p>This paper addresses an ongoing research-creation project aimed towards developing speculative souvenirs that commemorate Canadian disasters and disquieting truths. How do we reconcile the commercial nature of the tourist economy with more frank and honest depictions of a troubled nation?</p>

		    		<h3><i>Reimagining a Crime of Passion: Architectural Ruins as an Ambivalent Memorial in Millais’s Illustration (1857) for Tennyson’s</i> The Sisters <i>(1832)</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Larissa Vilhena</strong><span class="school">, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland</span></li>	
		    		</ul>
    				<p>As one of the fifty-four illustrations featured in Alfred Tennyson&rsquo;s Poems (1857), or the &ldquo;Moxon Tennyson,&rdquo; the design for <i>The Sisters</i>, created by Pre-Raphaelite artist John Everett Millais and engraved in wood by the Dalziels, stands out mainly due to its unusual subject matter. Within a volume of illustrations depicting either Romantic landscapes/seascapes subscribing to Edmund Burke&rsquo;s Sublime, or indoor scenes inhabited by various figures, Millais&rsquo;s picture baffles the viewer/reader at first glance. A rectangular stone tower occupies the largest portion of the pictorial space, with a few tall trees swinging in the wind and a full moon clearly distinguishable in the night sky. Human absence is a striking characteristic of Millais&rsquo;s visual interpretation of Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>The Sisters</i> (1832), a poem whose theme revolves around suicide and tragic death. Two sisters and an earl are involved in a story about love and hate, culminating in a crime of passion. And yet, Millais removes any traces of human activity in favour of architectural ruins in his final version. This paper shall investigate Millais&rsquo;s design and how the pictorial imagery relates to the poetic message. Instead of illustrating Tennyson&rsquo;s verse, Millais reimagines the story by choosing a seemingly unrelated subject. The medieval turret is presented as a mysterious site of remembrance which functions as an ambivalent memorial. While it commemorates the victim, the tower also hides the body and condones the crime. This paper shall explore the equivocal nature of architectural ruins in Millais&rsquo;s pictorial version of Tennyson&rsquo;s tragedy.</p>

    				<p class="bio"><strong>Larissa Vilhena:</strong> I am a PhD candidate researching the relationship between the illustration and the poetry in the 1857 illustrated edition of Alfred Tennyson&rsquo;s Poems, known as the &lsquo;Moxon Tennyson&rsquo;. Crossing the disciplinary boundaries of art history, literary criticism and material culture, my project examines the pictorial against the text from a visual analytical perspective. I received my BA in Art History and Architectural History from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and my MA in European Art History and History from Heidelberg University, both in Germany. In 2017 I was awarded an Erasmus+ grant as part of the European Liberal Arts Network (ELAN) to conduct interdisciplinary research into the Irish watercolour painter Frederic William Burton in the Department of History of Art and Architecture at TCD, which was combined with the MPhil Art + Ireland programme (2017-2018). My main research interests include nineteenth-century illustration and Pre-Raphaelite art.</p>
