		    		<p>Artist-run centres (ARCs) have undoubtedly helped to shape Canadian culture, yet their histories have been understudied in both art history and museum studies. This roundtable invites participants to dialogue about how we can better account for ARCs in Canadian art history and why–against a backdrop of increasing equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility throughout the art world–the history of ARCs is so pressing right now. If ARCs truly were, and continue to be, parallel institutions, how have they challenged hegemonic discourses of authority, artistic agency, equity, and accessibility and how do these challenges contribute to a richer understanding of cultural history in Canada? We invite participants to apply to this roundtable whose professional experience and/or research takes up these concerns at both a practical and theoretical level.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Celia Vara</strong><span class="school">, Moving Image Research Lab &ndash; McGill University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>How does Groupe Intervention Video (GIV) archives are a political action that value the body as a site for personal and political kinds of learning and what kind of knowledge do such corporeal practices produce? This paper explores Spain and Latin America 1970s-80s feminist film and video archives at the GIV. GIV is an independent artist run centre &ldquo;dedicated to the promotion of videos created by women (in its most inclusive definition) by distributing and presenting them&rdquo; (GIV website). It emerged during the important activist wave of Quebec&rsquo;s alternative media movement of the 1960s and 70s. At the crossroads of longevity, consistency, commitment and the precarity that accompanies most forms of feminist labour, GIV is one of the most important &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; archives of feminist organizing and expression in Quebec. I work closely with the notion of kinesthetic empathy, to argue that the sense of our body position and movement relates to our awareness of the space we occupy (Kinesthesia). Kinesthetic empathy can engage in and with another&rsquo;s movement or sensorial experience of movement (Sklar, Reynolds and Reason, Foster). That permit experimentation and creation of new bodily routines and, therefore, a form of agency (Noland, Reynolds and Reason, Foster) that allows for subtle corporeal resistance in conditions of body repression/restrictions such as dictatorships. Based on these concepts, I explore 1970s-80s filmed performances (Spain and Latin America) archived at GIV and that are in consonance.</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>Beyond providing community for artists, artist-run centres (ARCs) have fostered vital communication networks. These, in turn, have created spaces for central discussions in the cultural sector, including conversations about artists’ material conditions. Drawing on an ongoing collaborative project assessing the Independent Artists’ Union (IAU), I suggest one way to account for the history of ARCs in Canada is through attention to their publications, including ARC newsletters, as well as the sectoral publication <i>Parallelogram</i>. In the case of the IAU—a tenacious group of Ontario artists who set out in the 1980s to organize the province’s artists into a new collective agency—key conversations about labour and advocacy for artists as workers took place in these venues. Thus, the history of artists’ engagement with labour lies in these texts, while simultaneously we find that ARCs were a pivotal communication network through which the IAU advanced its work. In fact, our research reveals that the union leveraged existent ARC infrastructure to develop locals outside of Toronto. Through this historic case study, I suggest we might think about how ARCs have challenged hegemonic discourses about cultural work, which resonate with the art world’s ongoing reckoning with its own labour economy.</p>

		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Karen Knights<!-- &amp; Emma Metcalfe Hurst--></strong><span class="school">, VIVO</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>Knights will reflect on the strong archival impulse of west coast ARCs and, specifically, the Satellite Video Exchange Society (known publicly as VIVO Media Arts Centre) and its Crista Dahl Media Library &amp; Archive (CDMLA). This CDMLA differs from many across the country. In addition to archiving its own records and a media library of international independent video, it holds the archives of now-defunct sister organizations including Metro Media (1971&ndash;1984); Women In Focus Media and Distribution Archives (1972&ndash;1992); and the First Nations Video Collective (1990&ndash;2000), as well as personal archives of artists and activists Sara Diamond, Margaret Dragu, Lenore Herb, Joe Sarahan, and Mary Anne McEwen, among others. Knights will discuss the institution&rsquo;s decision to archive its own history in-house and the pros and cons of that decision across the past 50 years. She will examine the centre&rsquo;s participation in three recent collaborative projects that aim to expand the accessibility of ARC collections and their impacts on the activities on the SVES: Recollective: Vancouver Independent Archives Week, an ARC-initiated and defined project; Crossing Fonds, a SSHRC investigating the potential for a platform that can seamlessly bridge the collections of ARC, community, academic, and government archives; and Archive/Counter-Archive that partners ARCs with academic researchers. Finally, Knights will situate ARC history within the context of its newly &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; value. Is it possible for an external history-telling practice to not be extractive?</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Mariane Bourcheix-Laporte</strong><span class="school">, Simon Fraser University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>This presentation draws from research in process undertaken in the development of my doctoral dissertation. The research maps processes of institutionalization that artist-run centres (ARCs) in British Columbia (BC) have undergone in relation to, and as a result of, interactions with cultural policy frameworks and processes at the federal, provincial, and sectoral level. The research looks at the inherent friction existing between the administrative logics of artist-run centres &ndash; what Vincent Bonin (2010) has coined as the &ldquo;paradigm of self-determination&rdquo; &ndash; and the administrative logics of government with regard to culture &ndash; what cultural policy theorists (Bennett, 1998; Miller &amp; Y&uacute;dice, 2002; O&rsquo;Brien, 2014) have, following Foucault&rsquo;s (1991) ideas, understood as instruments of governmentality. The research first develops a history of ARCs and analyzes the emergence of &ldquo;generations&rdquo; of BC ARCs (1960s-70s, 1980s-90s, 2000s) in relation to developments in federal and provincial cultural policies and funding agencies, and changes in the structure and self-governance of ARC networks in Canada. Processes of institutionalization are analyzed through the lens of discursive institutionalism, which considers the role of ideas and discourse in the formation and transformation of institutions, which are understood as social structures collectively recognized and acknowledged as such.</p>
					<p>The presentation will discuss the following levers of institutionalization, with examples drawn for the BC ARC network between 1967 and 2020:</p>
					<ul style="margin-top:-1rem;margin-left:1rem;margin-right:1rem;">
						<li style="margin-bottom:1rem;">Influence of/engagement with external policy frameworks: legal frameworks; funding agencies and programs; advocacy campaigns and interventions in policy processes)</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom:1rem;">Participating in ARC networks: affiliation to an ASO (ANNPAC, ARCA, PAARC, etc.); self-theorization of ARCs, ARC discourse, and emerging arts practices (video, sound art, performance); network professionalization through sectoral standards (CARFAC fees, contract templates)</li>
						<li>Professionalization at the ARC level: organizational structures; employees and employment standards; capital projects and longevity</li>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Michael Zyrd</strong><span class="school">, York University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>This proposed contribution to the roundtable would outline a larger project that investigates the history of film cooperatives and other artist-run centres (ARCs) in Canada, starting in 1967, when Intermedia and Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre were founded. Despite the current vibrancy of the Canadian independent film and media arts sector, there is a significant historical gap in scholarly accounts of Canadian film and media. Moreover, the relationship of film and media co-ops to other ARCs has not received sufficient scholarly attention despite the post-digital convergence of film/media and visual arts. As is true of many ARCs, the chronic precarity of the independent sector means that the basic documents that ground its history are scant and dispersed. My project&rsquo;s priority is to assess the status of co-op documentation and collect vital materials for archives before undertaking critical analysis of these research materials to generate new histories that incorporate a decolonization, equity, diversity, and inclusion (DEDI) lens to address what Deanna Bowen (2019) calls the appalling &ldquo;deficiency&rdquo; of diversity in Canadian media arts history. The project hopes to expand Canadian film and media arts history to make it more inclusive of the diversity of grassroots cultural communities that engaged in independent experimentation across multiple media forms. This project asks, what has been the impact and legacy of the co-op sector on the cultural ecology of the arts in Canada, including media arts and industry? This project is supported by a 2022 SSHRC Insight Grant, &ldquo;Expanding the History of Film and Media Co-ops in Canada since 1967.&rdquo;</p>
