		    		<p>As art museums and galleries across North America slowly undergo long-awaited changes addressing systemic racism, discrimination, and heteropatriarchy, there is a need for clearly documented curatorial and &ldquo;curatorial-like&rdquo; (Gilchrist 2018) methodologies and strategic innovations preceding and paralleling current dominant conventions, that challenge the legacies of colonialism. Exhibitions and initiatives such as &#699;Ai P&#333;haku, Stone Eaters (University of Hawaii M&#257;noa, multi-site, 2023), Ayumi Goto and Peter Morin: How Do You Carry the Land? (Vancouver Art Gallery, 2018), lippunga: The Brousseau Inuit Art Collection (Mus&eacute;e des beaux-arts nationale du Qu&eacute;bec, 2016), and BUSH Gallery (Secwepemc&uacute;&#322;ecw, 2013&ndash; ) demonstrate deep and considered employment of such emergent and establish methodologies. This panel invites papers and presentations that explore practices redefining curation and expand the accessible record of such curatorial methodologies occurring within academic, museum and gallery, artist-run, land-based, independent, and other contexts.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Chanon Kenji Praepipatmongkol</strong><span class="school">, McGill University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>As artist Simryn Gill puts it, &ldquo;Nature has very different logic in different places. And where I grew up nature is very fast. You just have to take your eyes off the ball and you're underneath it again! I lived in a landscape that was said to not hold much history because human traces there rot quickly.&rdquo; While she was speaking of Malaysia&rsquo;s coastal rainforests, Gill&rsquo;s remark conjures the specter of a colonial attitude that justified the denigration of &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; cultures globally: quick nature makes for fast forgetting and shallow history. Variations of this climatically-determinist argument have been applied to peoples who created objects that were organic and perishable, and whose making refuses to find static resolution in things that can be conserved, at least by the standards of modern museology.</p>
					<p>Based at Singapore Art Museum, <i>Shallow</i> (2021&ndash;2024) is a long-term curatorial and research project that takes the tropic&rsquo;s uniquely accelerated time-genre as a starting point to excavate histories of climate control, art conservation, and conceptual art. If there was a moment in the mid-twentieth century when champions of tropical architecture envisioned a future of museums without air-conditioning, why was that path forsaken? How did the environmental standards associated with the storage of oil painting (~20 degrees Celsius, ~50% relative humidity) come to be universalized in contemporary art museums, even as such conditions do not accord with the needs of recent art? What have artists done to create alternative conditions that reflexively respond to the rise of a globally standardized&mdash;and globally unsustainable&mdash;climate infrastructure in recent decades?</p> 
					<p>This presentation will chart the trajectory of this project, which will culminate in a series of publications and programs by artists Simryn Gill and Charles Lim in 2024. The goal of this sharing is to generate a dialogue about the often-conflicting relationship between artistic desires to let art decay, die, and be transformed, and institutional desires for the prolongation of art&rsquo;s life. How might museums commission, show, and collect works that do not accord with the institution&rsquo;s attitude towards conservation or environmental control? What role do artists have to play in shaping the future of conversations around institutional commitments to addressing climate emergency at an infrastructural level?</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Julia Prudhomme</strong><span class="school">, McMaster University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>This paper draws on the theoretical orientation and case study analysis of Chapter Three of my doctoral dissertation.</p> 
					<p>From a post-capitalist feminist lens, I investigate the commons as a counter-hegemonic site and temporal phenomenon within capitalist structures, especially in the current financialized neoliberal capitalist contexts. I begin by exploring the socio-historical commons that serve as a device of capitalism through the enclosures. By establishing the contradictions of the commons, I endeavour to turn towards commoning (Harvey, 2011) through a politics of care that enacts a transdualist theoretical orientation to stay below the dualism of capitalist logic (Xiang, 2018).</p>
					<p>Commoning processes establish the ground to perform and analyze feminist curatorial commoning practice in contemporary art contexts. The second part of this paper investigates contemporary art practices that embrace the contradictions of the commons and commoning through the site of the garden. Underscoring the interdependency of social reproduction, collective action, and the environment as a political post-capitalist project, the garden becomes a site to explore relationality, slowness, and care within contemporary art contexts. These initiatives primarily occur within urban sites and large-scale exhibition complexes that have proliferated alongside burgeoning strategies of slowness and care in the curatorial. This paper, instead, explores the possibilities of feminist commoning processes from within the rural artist-run centre through a case study analysis of an exhibition-led project, dig a hole in the garden (June&ndash;July 2022) at Oxygen Art Centre, co-curated with Greta Hamilton and featuring artists Shannon Garden-Smith and T&rsquo;uy&rsquo;t&rsquo;tanat-Cease Wyss.</p>

		    		<h3><i>A Curator&rsquo;s Perspective on a Collection and its Institutional Histories</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Marisa C. Sa&#769;nchez</strong><span class="school">, Lycoming College</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>This paper discusses my curatorial methodology in <i>Time and Tide Flow Wide: The Collection in Context, 1959 &ndash; 1973</i>, a recent exhibition that I curated at the Colby College Museum of Art, which was on view for the duration of the 2022&ndash;2023 academic year (September 27, 2022 &ndash; June 11, 2023). Starting from the premise that the art museum is a site of power, where knowledge is produced, exchanged, and sometimes contested, this exhibition invited viewers to consider the contexts in which artworks were collected and now reside at Colby, a liberal arts college in Central Maine on the Wabanaki homelands. Informed by new research, my approach revealed the networks of relationships that created the museum and brought into greater focus how the institution emerged during the 1960s, a defining decade not only for the Colby Museum, but also on the world stage, as calls for civil rights drove global protests. The exhibition drew on history, the museum&rsquo;s archive, and the College&rsquo;s Special Collections to explore important gaps and absences within the collection. During my research, several questions emerged including: Whose collecting priorities laid the foundation for this museum anchored in American art? Which artworks diverged from that emphasis? What subjects predominate in the collection? How might I contextualize artworks acquired in the early decades of the museum&rsquo;s history against the larger social, cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the period? And, relatedly, how can we better understand the collection from our perspectives today?</p>

		    		<h3><i>Anti-Colonial Museology Created by Artists</i></h3>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>This curatorial research project involves learning from artists who are creating their own archives and museums to develop what I am calling a theory and methodology of anti-colonial museology. Their works create archives and museums through methods often prohibited in such spaces: subjectivity, fiction, humor, non-linear conceptions of time, nuanced histories, Indigenous understanding of living objects, relatives and belongings, and community-based or collective practices of history-making. I cover Ecuadorian artist Fabiano Kuevas&rsquo; <i>Alexander Von Humbolt Archive</i>&mdash;made up of ethnography installations, performances, and video&mdash;which operates on the logic of the body, the found object, and the transit of objects to create what he describes a fictionalized account of history that question the imperial gaze. I also discuss the Travestite Museum of Peru, a conceptual artwork and archive that rewrites Peruvian history through the experiences of Indigenous and queer folks in Peru created by artist and philosopher Giuseppe Campuzano. This &ldquo;museum&rdquo; has taken the form of popular performance and performance art, protests, books, exhibitions, and interactive installations in streets and parks. It presents a new model for creating community-based living archives that consider Andean ideas of cyclical time and embodied communal history. Additionally, Ursula Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Mi&rsquo;kwite&rsquo;tmn (Do You Remember)</i> examines ideas of Mi&rsquo;kmaw ancestry, craft, and the collection practices of Indigenous cultural production, reflecting on the ethnographic gaze and the treatment of Indigenous belongings in museum collections. Through these works, anti-colonial museology is defined by not only including histories from disenfranchised communities, but presents a call to action to shift our thinking, our methodology, and our very working practices. It goes beyond simple representation, demanding to include missing histories in ways that are appropriate to how those histories function within their own contexts, often changing the very structure of history-production. </p>
