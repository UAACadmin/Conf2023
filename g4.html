		    		<p>This panel brings together artists working within professional art systems in so-called Canada and simultaneously participating in social movement building. Speakers will elaborate on the tensions between individual-focused art practices and the power of collective mobilizing for economic, racial, gender, disability, and environmental justice. Artists will discuss key political struggles, texts, and practical grassroots methods that inform their ongoing community-based work. In looking at the wins and challenges faced by anti-capitalist and anti-colonial groups, the panel will interrogate the question, &quot;What can artists learn from social movement organizing?&quot;</p>

    				<p>This presentation argues for the urgent necessity of critical engagement and political resistance through graphic practice. It draws on Kevin Yuen Kit Lo's experience as Founder and Principal of LOKI, a small Montreal-based graphic design studio committed to working with social movements toward radical political change. Lo will reflect on over fifteen years of community-based design work in parallel with long-term anarchist organizing. <i>Design Against Design</i> unravels the real-world relationships, motivations and contradictions in a socially engaged design practice.</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>Participation in the ecology of art is intractable from the dominant capitalist system which elevates the singular individual over all forms of collectivity. In order to address this contradiction, artists with a commitment to liberatory politics may take one of two tacts: either embracing a liberal ideology wherein all creative work is inherently radical, denying unavoidable complicities, or centring social issues in the subject of the art itself through pedagogic projects, confessional practices, and therapeutic or participatory methodologies. Counter to their aims of inducing collectivity through education or shared vulnerability, these practices tend to reinforce the delineation of the artist as individual experts, separated from the collective.</p> 
					<p>Building on the abolitionist and anti-violence frameworks of Jackie Wang, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Nimmi Gowrinathan, and Nancy Princenthal, we argue that the most effective bridge between collective organizing and artistic practice lies not in aesthetic convention or specific subject matter, but in the relationships we surround ourselves with and those we form across history through social movement research and participation. In understanding how communities are strengthened and expanded by feminist, anti-colonial, and anti-carceral organizing, we gain a roadmap for an effective and politically active artistic community. As partners and collaborators, we are participants in each other&rsquo;s political as well as personal lives. In refusing the boundaries between spheres of relation-making&mdash;arts, organizing, study, friendship, love&mdash;, we can create artworks that draw from and contribute to the goals of social organizing for bodily sovereignty, disability justice, and collective liberation.</p>

    				<p class="bio"><strong>M Gnanasihamany</strong> and <strong>HK Jackson</strong> are creative collaborators in Tio&rsquo;tia:ke with a shared practice exploring sex, desire, and collectivity in art historical and political contexts. HK Jackson completed her BFA in contemporary dance at Simon Fraser University (2017). Braiding together research, art making, and political organizing, her work in critical arts writing and performance art draws on her years of support and advocacy work with survivors of sexual violence. M Gnanasihamany holds a BFA in painting from the University of Alberta (2015). Their work in painting, poetry, and curation examines the political world of pictures through their dissemination, collection, and reproduction, with their most recent projects supported by Metatron Press, Critical Distance Centre for Curators, and Hollyhock Centre.

    				<p>Many contemporary art community projects are short-term and project-based, unlike the long-term and relationship-based models of existing migrant justice networks across the country. In this presentation, Waard Ward examines the role of resource redistribution and mutual aid for newcomers via the contrasting channels of art-based funding and informal community networks. By discussing their ongoing collaborative work of floristry and gardening, Waard Ward shares practical and theoretical ideas around the role of art, citizenship, and care in an era of increasing border restrictions.</p>
