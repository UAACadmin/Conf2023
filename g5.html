		    		<p>Early modern (1400&ndash;1700) interest in nature is made evident by the revival of villa gardens, the popularity of the pastoral in painting, theatre, music, and music, the fascination with the scientific properties and aesthetic qualities of plants, and creation of botanical gardens. While the complexities of early modern green spaces have been well-documented by scholars (such as Jodi Cranston, Karen Hope Goodchild, Natsumi Nonaka, and Paul Barolsky), their connections to the twentieth- and twenty-first century works deserve more attention. This panel will centre around art, film, and literature that perpetuate, remediate, and/or challenge ideas and practices surrounding early modern representations of nature. Contributions to this panel may address (but are by no means limited to) the following topics and themes: colonization or decolonization, LGBTQIA+ perspectives, ecofeminism, sustainability, transnationalism, migration, heterotopias and other theories of space, and posthumanism.</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p><i>Deshkan Ziibi/Antler River/Thames</i> is a long poem and a parallel text to the first song of Micheal Drayton&rsquo;s Poly-Olbion. The poem is a hybrid piece, engaging with the contemporary ecopoetics of Min Hyoung Song&rsquo;s <i>Climate Lyricism</i>, the creaturely being-with of Donna Harraway&rsquo;s <i>Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene</i>, and the phenomenological approach of Timothy Morton&rsquo;s <i>Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World</i>.</p> 
					<p>At its heart, <i>Deshkan Ziibi/Antler River/Thames</i> speaks to Drayton from our contemporary world of ecological crises and showcases how a presentist approach to early modern ecocriticism&mdash;or early modern understandings of green spaces&mdash;paves over more than it preserves. By positioning Drayton&rsquo;s depiction of the English River Thames as one parallel text and the Deshkan Ziibi (or Thames River) in London, Ontario as another, my poetic response highlights the way that Drayton&rsquo;s colonial space-making shapes how we encounter the world.</p>
					<p>The version of the talk I propose to give at UAAC 2023 will aim to reintroduce Drayton&rsquo;s mode of poetic topography as a method that opposes colonial cartography. This poetic topography, I argue, is capable of resiting colonial space-making and the ecological devastation that it entails. This approach, which draws connections between early modern maps and contemporary ecopoetics, will provide insight on how to think about early modern ecologies during our current climate crises.</p>

		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Ana Moyer</strong><span class="school">, University of Western Ontario</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>Flemish engraver Theodor de Bry took a central role in the iconography of both the &ldquo;found world&rdquo; and the people residing in it as an engraver for several of the most popular books depicting accounts of the Americas from a colonial perspective, such as Richard Hakluyt&rsquo;s Collected travels in the east Indies and west Indies (1590&ndash;1634). Despite his notable impact in creating a canon of anti-Indigenous iconography that remains some of the most recognizable to this day, De Bry was deeply affected by the Spanish persecution of the Protestants during the 1570s and was forced to flee from modern Belgium to Germany, creating a strong anti-Spanish sentiment. Ongoing publication of the book <i>A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies</i> by Dominican friar, Bishop and titled &ldquo;Protector of the Indians&rdquo; Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas largely coincided with Spanish and religious occupation, particularly during the Dutch revolt against Spain from 1555 to 1598.</p> 
					<p>As such, de Bry&rsquo;s inclusion as engraver for one of the first major publications of de las Casas&rsquo; book interrogates the artistic colonial modalities through which he depicted and employed, for once, anti-colonial narrative visual structures that reference and build upon his own iconography. In particular, I will focus on the effects of de Bry&rsquo;s images of a barren land with unclothed, generically Classical pagan people as a system of dehumanization and binarism between civility and barbarism. How does this iconography succeed or fail within the context of de las Casas&rsquo; book? I will attempt to juxtapose and examine these images to facilitate dialogue and expose how the artwork chosen to accompany Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas&rsquo; pro-Indigenous, anti-slavery, anti-colonial manifesto supports or subverts the messaging of the volume.</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>My thesis examines Peter Paul Rubens&rsquo; <i>The Rape of Proserpine</i> (1636-1638), a painting inspired by a Greek myth retold in Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>. Rubens&rsquo; painting was commissioned by Philip IV of Spain, to be part of a decorative program for the torre de la parada, a hunting lodge located in current-day Monte del Prado in Spain. The tower was decorated with a hundred and twenty paintings of animals, hunting scenes, contemporary portraits, and mythologies. Rubens and his studio were responsible for more than sixty mythological works, which turned the tower into a landscape of Ovidian images, many of which depict intense chases and abductions. My thesis explores how abduction and sexual violence was meant to be interpreted by visitors of the torre de la parada. While Rubens is well known for his paintings of abductions (as well as hunting), the scholarship around the torre commission is surprisingly contentious in considering its interpretation around Rubens intentions, whether they were erotic or empathetic. I have yet to see scholarship that correlates specifically, the scenes of abduction represented as hunting scenes in their own right. The distinction around the language of love and abduction, for what has been called &ldquo;the triumphs of love&rdquo; I call in this case a &ldquo;love hunt.&rdquo; This lack of scholarly distinction is further enhanced by my research in looking at Ovid&rsquo;s text, which reinforces seventeenth century rape imagery and rape culture to correlate &ldquo;love as a hunt.&rdquo;</p>

    				<p class="bio"><strong>Alexandra Argitis:</strong> I am an independent scholar, and recent graduate from Concordia University's Art History Master program. My research interests include the mythologization of women in art history, but specifically of Rubens mythological rape imageries. Varying other research interests include Color Theory, as well as the philosophy of aesthetics (the exploration of ugliness). My academic efforts are always to contemporize (make relatable) academia to close the gap between the supposed distance between our histories. I also blend my research with my own art practice, believing understanding art begins with making it.</p>
