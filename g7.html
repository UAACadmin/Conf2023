		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Aubyn O&rsquo;Grady &amp; Jackie Olson</strong><span class="school">, Yukon School of Visual Arts | Yukon University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>In the early 2000s the arts were introduced as a viable economic alternative to the boom-and-bust resource extraction economy (gold mining) of Dawson City, Yukon, Tr&#700;ond&euml;k Hw&euml;ch&#700;in Territory. The Klondike Institute for Arts and Culture was established with the ultimate goal of creating an art school. As a mode of creative placemaking, the Yukon School of Visual Arts (YSOVA) &ndash; a partnership between Yukon University, the Tr&rsquo;ond&euml;k Hw&euml;ch&rsquo;in Government, and the Dawson City Arts Society- was envisioned as a site of community-oriented, experimental, and land-based art pedagogies. The school&rsquo;s sole offering, a foundation year program, welcomed its first cohort in 2007.</p>
					<p>Decades later, these beloved community organizations are experiencing institutional fatigue, in a state of perpetual adaptation responding to an acute housing shortage, increasingly unpredictable weather events like floods and forest fires, issues of land sovereignty and resource extraction, the desire for new and renewable energy sources, waste diversion, and food security.</p>
					<p>This paper describes the ongoing development of the Willow Basket Project at YSOVA, an experimental land/arts-based research and education program that employs art and creative approaches to address the most pressing environmental issues within our locale. The project framework acts as a basket to weave local interest, expertise and materials into a network of interdisciplinary and geographically diverse collaborators. For example, in the Project&rsquo;s first year we are collaborating with the Klondike Placer Miners Association to allow artists access to post-mined claims in the Goldfields before the reclamation process, through a &ldquo;Mining Artist in Residence&rdquo; program.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Ziyu Feng</strong><span class="school">, University of Arizona</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>With the rapid urbanization process in China, there has been a significant increase in rural migrant workers, resulting in a growing number of left-behind children in rural areas. These left-behind children in remote areas of China face various social challenges, including limited access to educational resources, cultural differences, and social marginalization. Art education plays a crucial role in fostering these children's comprehensive development, public engagement, and cultural experiences, providing them with appropriate engagement methods rooted in their cultural background. Based on the theoretical framework of public engagement, this study aims to explore the role of art education in promoting artistic engagement among Chinese left-behind children through various artistic interventions. The primary objective is to create opportunities for citizen empowerment, cultivate empathy, and foster a sense of belonging. The research methodology involves case studies focusing on the art program implemented at Jijiazhuang Primary School in Datong City, Shanxi Province, China. In addition, interviews will be conducted with teachers and children involved in the program, and in-depth analysis of real-life cases and scenarios will be undertaken. This research adopts a critical thinking approach to unveil the practical challenges left-behind children face in remote rural areas regarding art education. In response to these challenges, the study proposes education justice models and strategies to address the existing disparities. This research aims to advance equitable and inclusive educational practices in China's remote rural regions through comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the current state of art education for left-behind children.</p>

		    		<h3><i>Experiential learning as a capacity building tool for communities for Design Studies
students at the University of Alberta</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Gillian Harvey</strong><span class="school">, University of Alberta</span></p>
    				<p>Experiential learning has emerged as a powerful capacity-building tool for communities in various domains, including Design Studies. This paper focuses on the application of experiential learning as a capacity-building tool for Design Studies students at the University of Alberta, with the aim of fostering community engagement and empowering students to address real-world challenges. By immersing students in authentic, hands-on experiences, experiential learning offers a transformative educational approach that bridges the gap between theory and practice.</p>
					<p>This paper outlines the objectives, methodologies, and outcomes of the experiential learning program at the University of Alberta. Through partnerships with the Canadian Red Cross, students participated in a collaborative project that required them to apply design principles and methodologies to community clarify overdose education response offerings when severe threats to community health and resilience are compromised. By working closely with community members and subject matter experts, students gained valuable insights into the social, cultural, and political contexts.</p>
					<p>The outcomes of this experiential learning program are twofold. First, through human-centred design methodologies, students develop a deep understanding of the challenges faced by communities and the role of design in addressing these challenges. They learn to approach design from a human-centered perspective, considering the social and cultural implications of their work. Through this process, the community benefits from the innovative solutions proposed by the students, creating a positive impact on the lives of community members.</p>
					<p>This paper highlights the significance of experiential learning as a capacity-building tool for Design Studies students. By combining theoretical knowledge with practical experiences, students are equipped with the skills and experience necessary to become effective designers for social good. The program serves as a platform for nurturing socially conscious design practitioners who can contribute to the betterment of communities through their creative and innovative approaches within a health context.</p>

		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Jennifer Eiserman</strong><span class="school">, University of Calgary</span></p>
    				<p>This presentation will describe how the <i>YYC/LRT: Community-based Art as Community Development</i> project brought the University of Calgary, the City of Calgary and Contemporary Calgary together to learn and grow with members Calgary&rsquo;s Downtown West community. Over the past two years, the community studio <i>YYC/LRT</i> (originally created by Bryan Faubert as an MFA thesis project) has been situated in the Downtown West community as a satellite of Contemporary Calgary. From the community studio, undergraduate and graduate students have developed community-based art programming for economically and ethno-culturally diverse members of the community, aged 6 to 94. This presentation will discuss the theoretical context for <i>YYC/LRT</i>, built on approaches within contemporary art that favour relational (Bourriaud,1998) and participatory (Bishop, 2006, 2012, 2013) approaches. Foundational to the project is relational aesthetics&rsquo; view of artists as facilitators who act to empower viewers through engagement in specific social contexts. It will present a new approach to teaching and learning, &ldquo;sociogogy&rdquo; (Saveri, 2019). Rather than focusing on the object of instruction, sociogogy&rsquo;s focus is the evolution of the learner, and by extension, communities of learners. Sociogogy brings people together to learn from and with each other. It is a collaborative process in which the roles of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; and &ldquo;learner&rdquo; shift as necessary (Saveri, 2019). This presentation will describe how three key community engagements brought the university, the art gallery and a community together to collaborate in the creation of bodies of work to learn from each other about what the Downtown West community needs to thrive.</p>

    				<p class="bio"><strong>Jennifer Eiserman:</strong> I have been engaged in community-based art and collaborative practice for twenty-three years. The importance of making, learning, and understanding together are the driving force of my research and teaching practices. As a result, my teaching practice engages students in collaborative, community-based inquiries through practical experiences in settings as diverse as working with the homeless families of Inn from The Cold to, most recently, seniors in Calgary’s Downtown West. I am actively engaged in community-based arts groups in Calgary, including co-curator of the TBT Gallery committed to promoting Jewish Calgary artist. The community basis of this work has led me to inquire into issues involving ethnicity and identity in art/art education, including research into the nature of the contribution of Canadian artists of Chinese descent on Canadian art and currently, the role of community art in community development through involvement in the Future of Stephen Avenue project, City of Calgary.</p>

Students of the program come from across what is known as Newfoundland and Labrador, mainland Canada, and international locations.</p>
					<p>Through reviewing two special topics courses, Wilson and Forbes share a pedagogy which centres our unique region. We ask, how can we make opportunities for our students to learn from the people, narratives and experiences that make this place a home and an ecological community? How can we contribute to this place as an active site of visual culture?</p>
					<p>Wilson&rsquo;s course, &ldquo;Expanded Site&rdquo;, brings students to live at the Bonne Bay Aquarium and Research Station in Gros Morne National Park, transforming the laboratories into studios. Situated in the close-knit community of Norris Point, the course fosters idea generating and self-directed practice through relational approaches to art making, interdisciplinary fieldwork, and collaboration.</p>
					<p>Forbes&rsquo; &ldquo;Drawing and Public Space&rdquo; engages with community garden sites through expanded drawing practices. Developed and led in collaboration with cultural spaces consultant, Sabrina Richard, students meet with residents, city planners and green space users to generate and contextualize their individual and collaborative drawing projects.</p>

		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Dianne Pearce de Toledo</strong><span class="school">, Independent Artist and Researcher</span></p>
    				<p>After moving to Mexico and forming the Intercultural Documentation Centre in the 1960s, Ivan Illich advocated for de-institutionalisation in favour of more convivial forms of education where celebration, open-endedness and egalitarianism were paramount for lifelong learning. At the same time across the world in Russia, the concept of tusovka (hanging out) was manifesting Illich&rsquo;s convivial forms: the underground intellectual community of 1960s Moscow met in bars to translate banned Western books and create illegal conceptual art.</p> 
					<p>Thirty years later, French curator Nicolas Bourriaud wrote that the role of artwork is no longer to form utopian realities but to be &lsquo;ways of living&rsquo; within the existing real&mdash;the gallery space becomes a place where being together is central to collective meaning. He wrote about the urbanisation of the artistic project and implored educational institutions to reform.</p>
					<p>Indeed, since the mid-nineties universities have launched cultural studies programs in which disciplines were newly gathered under the term interdisciplinarity. Not content with how this soon became mainstream, cultural theorist W. J. T. Mitchell coined the more transgressive concept of &lsquo;indiscipline&rsquo;: that &ldquo;moment of chaos or wonder when a discipline, a way of doing things, compulsively performs a revelation of its own inadequacy.&rdquo;</p>
					<p>Fast forward to 2012 when Elizabeth Merritt, futurist and director of the Institute for the Future of Museums, predicted in her annual TrendsWatch that education reform and alternative ways of learning were the most important trends to watch. She wrote that the learning landscape would be reinvented and ten years on we are witnesses to this evolving process.</p>
					<p>Having worked as an artist, art instructor, museum curator, and now municipal cultural administrator I have lived these changes over the past two decades. This paper will present the transformation of art and art education into a social work of sorts, resulting in the creation of artist citizens participating in a global society.</p>
