		    		</ul>
    				<p>This presentation will consider the interwoven legacies of weavers on the Canadian prairie during a period of radical changes to weaving practice. In <i>Thinking Through Craft</i>, Glenn Adamson argues that craft is a horizon that constitutes a &ldquo;conceptual limit active throughout modern artistic practice.&rdquo; The artists of <i>Prairie Interlace: Textile Modernisms and the Expanded Frame</i> have interrogated this conceptual limit both on and off their looms, weaving at the horizon where textile traditions are  challenged by artistic innovations of form, materiality and context. The work that resulted from this process offers a unique parallel record of the struggle for art world legitimacy undertaken by weavers and curators who instigated and sustained the fibre art movement in Europe and the United States. Weavers and artists on the Canadian prairies were influenced not only by their local contexts but also by what they read in periodicals or learned from travelling artist/weavers. Using several of the artists featured in <i>Prairie Interlace</i>, I will attempt to unpick overlapping contexts that have informed their work including: perennial efforts towards the revival of handweaving; the establishment of local guilds and programs for weaving education; the push for the professionalization of fine craft, and the prairie  landscape itself. While many of the artists in Prairie Interlace have had international careers exhibiting their work around the world, some of their weaving evokes a kind of made-on-the-prairies sensibility in which landscape and the prairie horizon are enmeshed with various subjectivities related to place and identity.</p>

    				<p>Study of the Metis people&rsquo;s artistic achievements has been a growing field in recent years. Much attention has been paid to their beadwork, and to a lesser extent, silk embroidery work. While this is excellent progress for the inclusion of the Metis in  the Canadian Art History cannon, a lesser-known Metis art form, rug hooking, has not been as well represented.</p> 
					<p>This presentation will examine hooked rugs produced within Metis families and communities within what is now known as  Saskatchewan, focusing heavily in on the works of the Pelletier/Racette family from the Qu&rsquo;Appelle Valley. It will also show evidence of rug hooking existing as continuous practice for over a century, existing as a central economic driver for road allowance families through the reservation era, and discuss the current practice of rug hooking among Metis artists.</p>

    				<p>The latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century witnessed a vast expansion of Feminist and Craft practice, theory, criticism, and curatorial methods. While many artists in <i>Prairie Interlace: Weaving, Modernisms and the Expanded Frame</i>, identify/ied as textile or fibre artists, and as feminists, not all do/did. These divergences reflect a textile and/or feminist identity navigating an artistic and social space where the very notion of identity was being questioned. These works are/were a material manifestation for a desire for connections, smooth or snagged. They took up modernist key gestures such as truth to materials and abstraction, and intertwined activist, affective, poetic, and aesthetics purposes to suggest how textile can been used to advance a political agenda as well as to make material engagement synonymous with community participation. In every act of making there is an expectation for meaning, but it is rarely an explanation or a proposition. At best, it is an insinuation that opens up a space for complicity, contrast, equivalence, confirmation or conflict. These textile works invented new interpretative devices to foretell other ways to tell stories, lives, subjectivities and bodies from the cradle to the barricade.</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>In co-curating the MacKenzie Art Gallery/Nickle Galleries exhibition <i>Prairie Interlace: Weaving, Modernisms, and the Expanded Frame</i>, I have been struck by the independence of weaving and other textile artforms from the conventional frame of Western art. Framing as a physical device seems an unnecessary addition for objects which carry their own means of internal support. But more than that, it became apparent to me that the hard edge of the frame represents a foreign energy for objects whose edges were softly looped or knotted. In this paper, I propose that textile art carries its own independent frame, even while operating within the frame of Western art. If the frame of art may be defined as a parergon or &ldquo;the work beside,&rdquo; as proposed by Jacques Derrida in <i>The Truth in Painting</i>, then I would counter that the frame of weaving is defined by a <i>synergon.</i> or &ldquo;the work together.&rdquo; In making this proposal, my aim is to expand on Glenn Adamson&rsquo;s conceptualization of craft as a supplement of art, a multi-faceted parergon encompassing weaving, woodworking, ceramics, glass, etc. While this is a useful construct, it would seem incomplete, for the specific energy  of textiles derives from its relationship to its own supplement: the binding, knotting, interweaving, and looping which transforms individual threads into textile. Following the cultural anthropology of Ren&eacute; Girard, I will show how both frames are ultimately located in the sacred. While art invokes the sacrificial victim through the phantom limb of aesthetic presence, weaving carries the potential to touch and clothe that limb. When weaving  becomes art, the touchless frame meets the frame of touch. This ability to touch defines the expanded frame of weaving, a frame that allows for contacts to extend along the many deterministic threads upon which society hangs&mdash;the &ldquo;bad habits of the West,&rdquo; as tapestry artist Ann Newdigate has so trenchantly called them.</p>

		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Sherry Farrell Racette</strong><span class="school">, University of Regina</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>Ta-hah-sheena was a rug-making co-operative on Standing Buffalo First Nation that merged the bold graphics of Dakota narrative symbology with latch-hook wool rug-making techniques. The co-operative originated from a two-week class organized by Lorna Bell  Ferguson, the wife of a local teacher. However, it was female elders, led by Martha Tawiyaka, who were the creative engine of the project. At its peak, the co-operative had forty-eight members ranging in age from eighteen to ninety-two. Although it was based on the co-operative model popular at the time, the underlying structure was the Dakota <i>ti&oacute;&scaron;paye</i>, the complex network of extended families centered around women. Artists were often sisters, aunties, cousins, and sisters-in-law. These relationships enhance the elder advisors&rsquo; capacity and comfort in transferring knowledge to younger members.</p> 
					<p>The co-operative emerged at a time when each level of government viewed Indigenous creativity as an untapped natural resource that, if properly managed, could address  economic hardships. Having committed to Inuit co-operatives, the federal government  embraced &ldquo;Eskimo Art&rdquo; and was tentatively moving towards the idea of First Nations men as professional artists, but women were generally tethered to craft production for a low-end tourist market. With its bold, often large-scale woven rugs, Ta-hah-sheena hovered between categories. Despite international marketing efforts, the co-operative never found its place. However, the dynamic aesthetics of the surviving rugs, the pride associated with the co operative, and the persistence of rug-making among Standing Buffalo artists suggests the  potential for return.</p>

    				<p>Architectural textiles help us to negotiate our physical and emotional spaces. They guide us through entrances and passageways, along walls, across floors, and up and down stairs, serving as markers for our movement as we consciously or unconsciously become aware of their formal details and metaphorical or narrative content. Emphasizing both surfaces and voids, these interlacing structures  culturally and socially connect us through common visual and material languages to offer comfort, security, and delight. This paper will examine the architectural textiles of Saskatchewan artist Kaija Sanelma Harris (1939-2022) who for decades negotiated the complex world of architects, institutions, designers and consultants when producing aesthetically and culturally significant woven works. It will situate her architectural textiles produced during the height of the fiber arts movement within the  discourses of the time, including those swirling around the innovative Lausanne Biennial, the seminal publications of Mildred Constantine and Jack Lenore Larsen, and the anxieties expressed by architects along with responses to them from critics and scholar/practitioners.</p>
