    				<p>In many Chinese paintings from the first to eleventh centuries, there is a contrast in size between figures depicted on the same horizontal level. The most well-recognized pictorial contrast of this kind is found in several traditional figure paintings and engravings, where the more significant or honorable protagonists are depicted larger than the minor figures by their side to highlight their differing social status.
Besides visualizing a social hierarchy, this kind of contrast between the sizes of depicted figures was also used as a perspectival approach that visualizes the distance between spatial layers, whose implications and significance are often overlooked by modern viewers. Underlying this perspectival approach is the tendency to organize pictorial space from a first-person perspective, conveying the vision of a specific subject by shrinking the sizes of pictorial motifs according to their varied distance from him/her. This subject could be the protagonist depicted in the painting, the painter himself, or the intended viewer outside the pictorial space. In this article, I will examine scroll paintings and murals from the fifth to the eleventh centuries to illustrate the visual effects that this perspectival approach creates and reconstruct its evolution in Chinese painting history. Situating these pictorial representations in the cultural and ritual contexts in which they were created and the spatial contexts in which they were viewed, this article explores how this perspectival approach produced a specific visual experience from the intended viewer&rsquo;s point of view and why it was adopted by the painters or designers.</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>In 1973 a painting titled <i>Medicinal Herb Picker</i> (<i>Caiyao tu</i> &#25505;&#34277;&#22294;) was excavated from an eleventh-century Shakyamuni Buddha sculpture at the Liao dynasty (916-1125) Yingxian Pagoda at Fogong Temple in present-day Shanxi province. This painting, which has garnered relatively little attention in English-language scholarship, is variously described as depicting the male Daoist immortal, Shennong &#31070;&#36786;, or female Daoist immortals such as Maon&uuml; &#27611;&#22899; or Shangui &#23665;&#39740;. However, its location inside the Buddha sculpture prompts further consideration.</p> 
					<p>My paper looks beyond the strict confines of any one religious tradition by considering the social context of the painting&rsquo;s production. I place a particular focus on the representation of the figure&rsquo;s clothing and body to explore how and why the painter utilized motifs commonly associated with socially marginal figures, such as commoner women, ghosts, and beggars. In doing so, I suggest that the painter crafted an image of a female immortal or deity that is distinct from the idealized form, which typically shares conventions with representations of palace ladies.</p>
					<p>Through my analysis, I demonstrate that the Yingxian painting is a site of negotiation that attempts to balance social codes across gender, social, and religious categories. In conveying this balance, the figure can be read as one who exists in a realm away from society while simultaneously remaining fundamentally linked to the social world in which the work was painted.</p>

    				<p>Western Canadian Art Museums (WCAMs) have been collecting Chinese artworks since at least the early twentieth century. As part of the ongoing presence of East Asian art in WCAMs, these Chinese collections should serve as examples of important national heritage cultures, helping us to interpret the complexities of empire, the colonial and postcolonial periods, and the interaction of politics, history, art market diplomacy, and human rights between Canada, China, and Japan. Regrettably, the value of these collections is too often buried, misinterpreted, and ignored in the scattered texts and orphaned objects that make up the archives and collections.</p>
					<p>Norman MacKenzie is one of the most important collectors of Asian art in Prairie history. He collected many Asian artworks, including some exquisite Chinese ivory carvings, during the global colonial movement in the early twentieth century. The original collecting purpose of these Chinese ivory carvings was influenced by European aesthetics, imperialism, and nationalism. However, with the advancement of multiculturalism and government/museum policies, the interpretation and attitude of art institutions and communities towards these ivory sculptures have changed fundamentally. These ivory carvings are now regarded as an essential Canadian minority cultural heritage for preservation. This paper will explore how these Chinese collections participated in the Prairie art history and the historical and contemporary significance of Chinese culture and art to the development of Prairie culture.</p>

    				<p>A palace courtyard, an apartment building, a hospital, a tea house. Are paintings of such urban places windows on the city? We might arrive at an answer to this question by first asking more simply, what is a window? This paper explores oil paintings by four Chinese artists who encountered the capital city of Beijing through window frames from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. It conceptualizes their project by way of Qian Zhongshu&rsquo;s &#37666;&#37912;&#26360; elegantly written essay &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; &#31383; (1948) in the anthology <i>Arriving at the Margins of Life</i> &#23531;&#22312;&#20154;&#29983;&#37002;&#19978;.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Jacob Zhicheng Zhang</strong><span class="school">, University of Toronto</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>When Zheng Shengtian (born 1938) embarked on his two-year sojourn in the United States and Western Europe, he was tasked to return in 1983 with his learnings to the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (ZAFA), where he taught as a professor. In this paper that foregrounds this experience abroad, I analyze three events&mdash;all from 1985, the namesake year of the &ldquo;85 Art New Wave&rdquo; episode of contemporary Chinese art&mdash;in which Zheng was involved to different extents as an organizer, supervisor, or critic. The May oil painting workshop led by the Paris-based ZAFA alumnus Zao Wou-Ki (1921&ndash;2013), the July graduate exhibition at ZAFA, and the November <i>Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange: ROCI China</i> exhibition at the National Art Museum constitute the events I investigate. In contrast to contextualizing these events differentially as their involved figures might suggest, I intend to bring their continuity into focus, drawing on Zheng, his notion of postmodernism, and his interlocutors in and outside the academy as a grouping mechanism. I argue that Zheng espouses a particular vision of postmodernism and embraces it in the socialist context. In rebranding postmodernism as pluralist and identifying Chinese artworks created in its proximity as &ldquo;sincere&rdquo; and &ldquo;[serving] socialism and the people,&rdquo; Zheng and his colleagues counter the reported uniformity of socialist art, not to break away from the academy but to expand its future legacy.</p>

		    		</ul>
    				<p>For over 30 years, Chinese artist Liang Shaoji (b. 1945, Shanghai) has been engaged with silkworms in his multi-disciplinary practices informed by Daoist cosmologies. In the mid-80s, he studied soft sculpture with fiber artist Maryn Varbanov (1932-1989) at the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (now China Academy of Art), where he incorporated raw silk and cocoons in his artworks for the first time. In 1989, Liang began to rear silkworms in his studio, and he has since established an intimate relationship with the species through care and invited silkworms to participate in his art-making processes. The spun silk strands, for Liang, are an embodiment of time and the environment, whereas the cocoon signifies a universe that embodies metamorphosis/ change. Liang&rsquo;s works are therefore beyond static installations but are time-based. In his suspended sculpture series <i>Chains: The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i> (2002-7), Liang put mature silkworms on gigantic iron chains to spin until the soft raw silk fully wraps the hard metal. In the sound installation, <i>Listen to the Silkworms</i> (2006-2021), Liang places racks of bamboo baskets with living silkworms and mulberry leaves in the gallery space. Their sound of consuming and spinning is recorded on-site and played simultaneously in the headphones nearby, creating a space for meditation. This paper suggests that Liang&rsquo;s artworks are a cross-species co-creation that reflects planetary aesthetics addressing the relationship and the entangled history of human and silkworms. As actants in Liang&rsquo;s works, silkworms mediate the human condition and natural elements in a more-than-human world.</p>
