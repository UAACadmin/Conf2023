		    		<p>This panel examines the structure of karaoke as a decolonial method that recentres power within the body for systematic change. This is in one part an invitation to folks at this panel session to pick songs, and sing, to end colonization in Canada. This application of Karaoke as a method for picking songs puts singers into a new kind of relation with each other and the land. During the song offering Kilpatrick and Morin will present work on the importances of repurposing of popular love songs as  an embodied and collective critique and confrontation settler colonialism. <i>Love Songs to End Colonization</i> is also a double-vinyl album and performance art object that invites singers, listeners, bodies to understand how physical spaces are complicated by colonization. In this session, Morin and Kilpatrick will open up a space for singers, and listeners, to know that we are the love songs transformed by cross-ancestral collaboration and liberation. Karaoke being prioritized as a creative methodology that centres joy and kindness. Following along the work of scholars like Dylan Robinson, and Susan Blight, Kilpatrick and Morin, through this session, are inviting participants to sing a future, a future where everyone is invited to add their intention/spirit to the creation of a world that isnâ€™t built on harming Indigenous bodies/territories/knowledges.</p>

    				<!--<p>In its maritime imagery, France expressed the most crucial condition of its empire. Without maritime trade and travel, France could not have built a colonial and economic empire during the long eighteenth century. Seafaring underpinned France&rsquo;s newly global commerce. However, the pictorial expression of this history is by no means simple. The slippage between real and fictive, aesthetics of verisimilitude and idealism, along with the professional impulses to both replicate and innovate, all characterize the marine paintings
and objects of France&rsquo;s ascension to world power and the distant artistic ripple effects in the middle of the eighteenth century that I explore in this paper. A crucial intersection of maritime scenes, topographical drawings and the formation of the French empire are present within Claude-Joseph Vernet&rsquo;s (1714&ndash;1789) Ports of France series and later disseminated engravings. The series transmutation and reception outside France is evident by the existence of Jean Patricio Morlette Ruiz&rsquo;s painted copies of the series along with Ruiz&rsquo;s novel views of Mexico City. This paper explores the category as defined by Vernet, the changes in perception of global economic ecosystem and the image of the port as a locus of political power throughout the globe for artists like Ruiz. By reframing these types of marine works through interdisciplinary methods pioneered in the fields of postcolonial and landscape studies this paper hopes to elucidate an overlooked genre and its global afterlives.</p>

    				<!--<p>In 1756 Claude-Joseph Vernet took a break from his royally-appointed project painting the ports of France to visit his home town of Avignon, executing a view of the city that now hangs in The Louvre. Vernet&rsquo;s Vues des Ports de France confected a maritime vision of the French kingdom as an economically productive, globally-expanding entity. These paintings arguably comply with current thinking in the &lsquo;blue humanities&rsquo; regarding the ocean as a site of nearly limitless potential to generate intercultural interactions, exchanges, and exploitation. By contrast, I propose that Vernet&rsquo;s Vue d&rsquo;Avignon posits rivers as a different kind of watery space; one of contested identities formed through the limiting factors freshwater sites pose to everyday human activities. My paper posits that a &lsquo;fluvial turn&rsquo; within the &lsquo;blue humanities&rsquo; can allow us to think further regarding the roles that freshwater has played in the formation of identities across global contexts, acting as demarcating yet unstable sites of cultural abutment.</p>
					<p>Owned at the time by the Papacy, Avignon represented an enclave within the French kingdom. Outlined by the Rh&ocirc;ne, a liquid body legally belonging to France&rsquo;s Bourbon monarchy, the unpredictable nature of the river frequently complicated the neat division of Avignon from France through flooding. Vernet&rsquo;s canvas reflects the fickle properties of the waterway as an untameable, active agency prone to changeability. As an Avignonnais painter in the employ of the French king, I argue that the artist depicts the complex place the river held as a boundary running through the Proven&ccedil;al landscape.</p>

    				<!--<p>In eighteenth-century France, the exclusive harem permeated the imaginations of European creatives and their audiences. Visual culture and literary narratives about the obscured quarters of Ottoman women generated themes based on a sultan&rsquo;s erotic desires and attempts by enslaved women to escape the confines of his captivity. This framework positioned women as the sexualized other and as powerless captives. But is there another story to tell, in which one of these concubines embodies a triumphal narrative of power and leadership? In viewing performances as international purveyors of visual culture and transmitters of sociopolitical discourse, I analyze Charles-Simon Favart&rsquo;s <i>op&eacute;ra-comique, Soliman II, ou Les trois sultanes</i> (1761) as an exponent of 18<sup>th</sup>-century 'turquerie' and an arena in which sociopolitical, gendered, and racial debates collide. The opera&rsquo;s content has been identified as a thinly-veiled analogue of the relationship between Madame de Pompadour and Louis XV. At the same time, Carle van Loo&rsquo;s painting of Madame de Pompadour as a sultana captures the ways that European women fashioned themselves in the guise of the other. While the visual arts illustrate the deployment of turquerie by elite European women, the medium operates within a broader artistic and colonial context that has garnered comparatively little scholarly attention. This paper interrogates how white European women mobilized cultural cross-dressing, in art and on stage, as a means of strategically performing the role of a sultana to cultivate their own identity as powerful women while at the expense of people of color.</p>
